      INTRODUCTORY NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      To dogmatise on questions of medical practice is to invite controversy and
      tempt disaster. The highest wisdom of to-day may be completely refuted by
      to-morrow&rsquo;s discovery. Therefore, for the simple principles of
      disease prevention and health protection which I have put into the mouth
      of my Health Master, I make no claim of finality. In support of them I
      maintain only that they represent the progressive specialized thought of
      modern medical science. So far as is practicable I have avoided questions
      upon which there is serious difference of belief among the authorities.
      Where it has been necessary to touch upon these, as, for example, in the
      chapter on methods of isolation in contagious diseases, a question which
      arises sooner or later in every household, I have advocated those measures
      which have the support of the best rational probability and statistical
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only has the book been prepared in consultation with the recognized
      authorities on public health and preventive medicine, but every chapter
      has been submitted to the expert criticism of specialists upon the
      particular subject treated. My own ideas and theories I have advanced only
      in such passages as deal with the relation of the physician and of the
      citizen to the social and ethical phases of public health. To the large
      number of medical scientists, both public and private, whose generous aid
      and counsel have made my work possible, I gratefully acknowledge my debt.
      My thanks are due also for permission to reprint, to the <i>Delineator</i>,
      in which most of the chapters have appeared serially; to <i>Collier&rsquo;s
      Weekly</i>, and to the <i>Ladies&rsquo; Home Journal</i>.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE eleven-o&rsquo;clock
      car was just leaving Monument Square when Mr. Thomas Clyde swung aboard
      with an ease and agility worthy of a younger and less portly man. Fortune
      favored him with an unoccupied seat, into which he dropped gratefully.
      Just in front of him sprawled a heavy-shouldered young man, apparently
      asleep. Mr. Clyde was unfavorably impressed both by his appearance and by
      the manner of his breathing, which was as excessive as it was unusual. As
      the car swung sharply around a curve the young man&rsquo;s body sagged at
      the waist, and lopped over toward the aisle. Before Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s
      restraining hand could close upon his shoulder, he had tumbled outward to
      the floor, and lay quiet, with upturned face. There was a stir through the
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horrid drunken creature!&rdquo; exclaimed a black-clad woman
      opposite Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Why do they allow such people on the cars?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor hurried forward, only to find his way blocked by a very
      tall, slender man who had quietly stepped, from a seat next the window,
      over an intervening messenger boy and the box he was carrying. The new
      arrival on the scene of action stooped over the prostrate figure. One
      glance apparently satisfied him. With a swift, sharp motion he slapped the
      inert man forcefully across the cheek. The sound of the impact was
      startlingly loud. The senseless head rolled over upon the left shoulder,
      only to be straightened out by another quick blow. A murmur of indignation
      and disgust hummed and passed, and the woman in black called upon the
      conductor to stop the assault. But Mr. Thomas Clyde, being a person of
      decision and action, was before the official. He caught the assailant&rsquo;s
      arm as it swung back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone! What do you mean by beating a helpless man that way!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know more about this affair than I do?&rdquo; The crisp
      query was accompanied by a backward thrust of the tall man&rsquo;s elbow
      which broke Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s hold, and&mdash;smack! smack!&mdash;the
      swift double blow rocked the victim&rsquo;s head again. This time the man
      groaned. The car was in an uproar. Mr. Clyde instantly and effectively
      pinned the tall man&rsquo;s elbows from behind. Some one pulled the bell,
      and the brakes ground, throwing those forward who had pressed into the
      aisle. Against this pressure, Mr. Clyde, aided by the conductor, began
      dragging his man backward. The stranger was helpless to resist this grip;
      but as he was forced away he perpetrated a final atrocity. Shooting out
      one long leg, he caught the toe of his boot under the outstretched man&rsquo;s
      jawbone and jerked the chin back. This time, the object of the violence
      not only groaned, but opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you in jail for that!&rdquo; panted Mr. Clyde, his
      usually placid temper surging up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other passengers began to lift the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop him!&rdquo; snapped the tall man, with such imperative
      decisiveness, that the helping hands involuntarily retracted. &ldquo;Let
      him lie, you fools! Do you want to kill him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Misgivings beset and cooled Mr. Thomas Clyde. He had now reached the rear
      platform, still holding in his powerful and disabling grasp the unknown
      man, when he heard a voice from an automobile which had been halted by the
      abrupt stop of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I be of any help?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Magruder!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;come in here, will
      you, and look at a sick man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the doctor stepped aboard, the captive with a violent wrench freed
      himself from Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s relaxing hold and dropped from the platform
      into the darkness. Dr. Magruder forced his way through the crowd, took one
      look at the patient, and, right and left, struck him powerfully across the
      cheeks time and again, until the leaden-lidded eyes opened again. There
      was a quick recourse to the physician&rsquo;s little satchel; then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the doctor cheerfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do
      now. But, my friend, with that heart of yours, you want to sign the pledge
      or make your will. It was touch and go with you that time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting to hear no more, Mr. Thomas Clyde jumped from the rear step and
      set off at a rapid pace, looking about him as he ran. He had not gone a
      block when he saw, by the radiance of an electric light, a tall figure
      leaning against a tree in an attitude of nerveless dejection. The figure
      straightened up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to man-handle me again,&rdquo; advised the man,
      &ldquo;or you may meet with a disappointment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to apologize.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned the other coolly; &ldquo;I appreciate
      it. Many a fool wouldn&rsquo;t go even so far.&rdquo; Mr. Clyde smiled.
      &ldquo;I own to the soft impeachment. From what Dr. Magruder said I judge
      you saved that fellow from the hospital.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judge I did&mdash;no thanks to you! You&rsquo;ve a grip like a
      vise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I keep in good training,&rdquo; said the other pleasantly.
      &ldquo;A man of my age has to, if he is to hold up his work.&rdquo; He
      looked concernedly at the stranger who had involuntarily lapsed against
      the tree again. &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      believe you&rsquo;re well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t believe I am,&rdquo; answered the tall man in
      uncompromising tones; &ldquo;but I do believe that it is peculiarly my own
      affair whether I am or not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Man, your nerves are on the jump. You used yourself up on
      that chap in the street car. Come across to my club and take something to
      brace you up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      People usually found it hard to resist Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s quiet
      persuasiveness. The stranger, after a moment of consideration, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin with a fight and end with a drink?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      a reversal of the usual process. If your cuisine runs to a cup of hot milk
      as late as this, I&rsquo;d be glad to have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the club, Mr. Clyde turned to his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name shall I register?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger hesitated. &ldquo;Strong,&rdquo; he said finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Strong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;Dr. Strong if you will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any place&mdash;Calcutta, Paris, Mexico City, Philadelphia, Rio. I&rsquo;ve
      tried &lsquo;em all. I&rsquo;m a man without a country, as I am without a
      profession.&rdquo; He spoke with the unguarded bitterness of shaken
      nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a profession! But you said &lsquo;Doctor.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A title isn&rsquo;t a profession,&rdquo; returned the guest
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning that over in his mind, Mr. Clyde led the way to a quiet table in
      the corner of the diningroom, where he gave his order. Observing that his
      new acquaintance was <i>distrait</i>, he swung into the easy
      conversational flow of a cultured man of the world, at the same time
      setting his keen judgment of men to work upon the other. There was much
      there to interest a close observer. The face indicated not much over
      thirty years; but there were harsh lines in the broad and thoughtful
      forehead, and the hair that waved away from it was irregularly blotched
      with gray. The eyes, very clear and liquid, were marred by an expression
      of restlessness and stress. The mouth was clear-cut, with an expression of
      rather sardonic humor. Altogether it was a face to remark and remember;
      keen, intellectual, humorous, and worn. Mr. Thomas Clyde decided that he
      liked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a traveler, Doctor?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve seen life in many countries&mdash;and death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And traced the relations between them, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve flashed my little pin-point lantern at the Great
      Darkness in the fond hope of discovering something,&rdquo; returned the
      other cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way, I&rsquo;m interested in those matters,&rdquo; continued
      Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve organized a Public Health League here, and
      made me president of it. More from finance than fitness,&rdquo; he added,
      humorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finance has its part, too,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Give me
      millions enough and I&rsquo;ll rid any city of its worst scourge,
      tuberculosis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wish to Heaven you had the millions to spend here in
      Worthington! We&rsquo;re in a bad way. Two years ago we elected a reform
      administration. The Mayor put in a new Health Officer and we looked for
      results. We&rsquo;ve had them&mdash;the wrong kind. The death rate from
      tuberculosis has gone up twenty-five per cent, and the number of cases
      nearly fifty per cent since he took office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; said the stranger, showing his first
      evidence of animation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Mr. Clyde stared.
      &ldquo;You think so? Then you&rsquo;ll undoubtedly be pleased to learn
      that other diseases are increasing almost at the same rate: measles,
      scarlet fever, and so on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And finally, our general mortality rate has gone up a full point.
      We propose to take some action regarding it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. You certainly ought to.&rdquo; Something in his guest&rsquo;s
      tone made Mr. Clyde suspicious. &ldquo;What action would you suggest,
      then? he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vote of confidence in your Health Officer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You propose that we indorse the man who is responsible for a marked
      rise in our mortality figures?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of all that&rsquo;s absurd, why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me answer that by another question. If disease appears in your
      household, do you want your doctor to conceal it or check it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde took that under advisement. &ldquo;You mean that this city has
      been concealing its diseases, and that Dr. Merritt, our new Health
      Officer, is only making known a condition which has always existed?&rdquo;
      he asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you just told me so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did I tell you anything of the sort?&rdquo; The younger man
      smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s five questions in a row,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;Time for an answer. You said that deaths from tuberculosis had
      increased twenty-five per cent since the new man came in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. Tuberculosis doesn&rsquo;t increase in sudden
      leaps. It isn&rsquo;t an epidemic disease, rising and receding in waves.
      It&rsquo;s endemic, a steady current.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look at the figures. Figures don&rsquo;t lie, do they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usually, in vital statistics,&rdquo; was the imperturbable reply.
      &ldquo;In this case, probably not. That is, they don&rsquo;t lie to me. I&rsquo;m
      afraid they do to you.&rdquo; Mr. Clyde looked dubiously at the propounder
      of this curious suggestion and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get it?&rdquo; queried Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Perhaps you
      recall the saying of Thoreau&mdash;I think it the profoundest
      philosophical thought of the New World&mdash;that it takes two to tell the
      truth, one to speak and one to hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that we&rsquo;ve misinterpreted the figures? Why, they&rsquo;re
      as plain as two and two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth lies behind figures, not in them,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re worried because of a startling apparent swelling
      of the tuberculosis rate. When you find that sort of a sudden increase, it
      doesn&rsquo;t signify that there&rsquo;s more tuberculosis. It signifies
      only that there&rsquo;s more knowledge of tuberculosis. You&rsquo;re
      getting the disease more honestly reported; that&rsquo;s all. Dr. Merritt&mdash;did
      you say his name is?&mdash;has stirred up your physicians to obey the law
      which requires that all deaths be promptly and properly reported, and all
      new cases of certain communicable diseases, as well. Speaking as a doctor,
      I should say that, with the exception of lawyers, there is no profession
      which considers itself above the law so widely as the medical profession.
      Therefore, your Health Officer has done something rather unusual in
      bringing the doctors to a sense of their duty. As for reporting, you can&rsquo;t
      combat a disease until you know where it is established and whither it is
      spreading. So, I say, any health officer who succeeds in spurring up the
      medical profession, and in dragging the Great White Plague out of its
      lurking-places into the light of day ought to have a medal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the other diseases? Is the same true of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to the same extent. No man can tell when or why the epidemic
      diseases&mdash;scarlet fever, measles, whooping-cough, and diphtheria&mdash;come
      and go. By the way, what about your diphtheria death rate here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the exception to the rule. The rate is decreasing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong brought his hand down flat on the table with a force which made
      his cup jump in its saucer. &ldquo;And your misnamed Public Health League
      proposes to take some action against the man who is shown, by every
      evidence you&rsquo;ve suggested thus far, to be the right man in the right
      place!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does the diphtheria rate show in his favor any more than the
      other death rates against him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because diphtheria is the one important disease which your medical
      officer can definitely control, and he seems to be doing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only important one? Surely smallpox is controllable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smallpox is the poisoned arrow of the fool-killer. It is
      controllable; but it isn&rsquo;t important, except to fools and
      anti-vaccination bigots.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thomas Clyde softly rubbed his cleanshaven chin, a sign and token with
      him that his mind was hard at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re giving me a new view of a city in which I&rsquo;ve
      lived for the first and last forty-five years of my life,&rdquo; he said
      presently. &ldquo;Are you familiar with conditions here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never have been here before, and have no reason to suppose that I
      shall ever return. Traveling at night is too much for me, so I stopped
      over to have a look at a town which has been rather notorious among public
      health officials for years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notorious!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Clyde, his local pride up in arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For falsifying its vital statistics. Your low mortality figures are
      a joke. Worthington has been more jeered at, criticized, and roasted by
      various medical conventions than any other city in the United States.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve never seen anything of that sort in the papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong laughed. &ldquo;Your newspapers print what you want to read;
      not what you don&rsquo;t want to read. They follow the old adage, &lsquo;What
      you don&rsquo;t know won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a poor
      principle in matters of hygiene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So one might suppose,&rdquo; returned the host dryly. &ldquo;Still
      you can scarcely expect a newspaper to run down its own city. I&rsquo;ve
      known business to suffer for a year from sensational reports of an
      epidemic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other grunted. &ldquo;If a pest of poisonous spiders suddenly bred and
      spread in Worthington, the newspapers would be full of it, and everybody
      would commend the printing of the facts as a necessary warning and
      safeguard. But when a pest of poisonous germs breeds and spreads, Business
      sets its finger to its lips and says, &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; and the
      newspapers obey. You&rsquo;re a business man, I assume, Mr. Clyde?
      Frankly, I haven&rsquo;t very much sympathy with the business point of
      view.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and pushed his chair back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Sit down. I have
      something that may be of importance to suggest to you. It occurs to me
      that Worthington would be the better for having a man with your ideas as a
      citizen. Now, supposing the Public Health League should offer you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at present in medical practice,&rdquo; broke in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even at that, I was thinking that you would be of use as an
      advisory physician and scientific lookout.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, the other&rsquo;s face brightened, an indication which Mr.
      Clyde was quick to note. But instantly the expression of eagerness died
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten hours a day?&rdquo; said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t
      be done properly in less time. And I&rsquo;m a mere nervous wreck, bound
      for the scrap-heap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde very gently, &ldquo;telling
      me what&rsquo;s wrong? I&rsquo;m not asking without a purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong held out his long arms before him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a surgeon
      without a right hand, and a bacteriologist without a left.&rdquo; The
      sinewy and pale hands shook a little. &ldquo;Neuritis,&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;One of the diseases of which we doctors have the most
      fear and the least knowledge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with the loss of your occupation, general nervous collapse?&rdquo;
      asked Mr. Clyde. Being himself a worker who put his heart into his work,
      he could guess the sterile hopelessness of spirit of the man banned from a
      chosen activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong nodded. &ldquo;I may still be fit for the lecture platform as a
      dispenser of other men&rsquo;s knowledge. Or perhaps I&rsquo;ll end up as
      medical watchdog to some rich man who can afford that kind of pet.
      Pleasing prospect, isn&rsquo;t it, for a man who once thought himself of
      use in the world?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde quietly. &ldquo;Will you try the
      position with my family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other stared in silence at his questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just consider my situation for a moment. As you know, I&rsquo;m a
      layman, interested in, but rather ignorant of, medical subjects. As wealth
      goes in a city of one hundred and fifty thousand population, I&rsquo;m a
      rich man. At any rate, I can afford a considerable outlay to guard against
      sickness. In the last five years I suppose disease has cost my household
      ten thousand dollars in money, and has cost me, in worry and consequent
      incapacity for work, ten times that amount. Even at a large salary you
      would doubtless prove an economy. Come, what do you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know absolutely nothing of me,&rdquo; suggested the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you are a man of quick and correct judgment, for I saw
      you in action.&rdquo; The other smiled. &ldquo;You are, for reasons which
      are your own, not very expansive, as to your past professional career. I&rsquo;m
      content with that attitude of yours, and I&rsquo;m quite satisfied to base
      my offer on what I have been able to judge from your manner and talk.
      Without boasting, I may say that I have built up a great manufacturing
      plant largely on my judgment of men. I think I need you in my business of
      raising a family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much of a family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five children, their mother and their grandmother. I may warn you
      at once that you&rsquo;ll have a jealous rival in Grandma. She&rsquo;s the
      household guardian, and pretty &lsquo;sot&rsquo; in her ideas. But the
      principal thing is for you to judge me as I&rsquo;ve judged you, and
      determine whether we could work out the plan together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong set his chin in one thin, cupped hand and gazed consideringly
      upon the profferer of this strange suggestion. He saw a strong-built,
      clear-skinned man, whose physical aspect did not suggest the forty-five
      years to which he had owned. Mr. Clyde recommended himself at first sight
      by a smooth-voiced ease of manner, and that unostentatious but careful
      fitness of apparel which is, despite wise apothegms to the contrary, so
      often an index of character. Under the easy charm of address, there was
      unobtrusively evident a quick intelligence, a stalwart self-respect, and a
      powerful will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, the doctor noted, this man had been both ready and fair in yielding
      his judgment, under the suggestion of a new point of view. Evidently he
      could take orders as well as give them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;have you appraised me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The weary eyes of the other twinkled a little. &ldquo;Physically you
      disclose some matters plainly enough, if one wishes to show off in the
      Sherlock Holmes manner. For instance, you&rsquo;ve recently been in the
      tropics; your eyesight is better than your hearing, you drink lightly if
      at all, and don&rsquo;t use tobacco in any form; you&rsquo;ve taken up
      athletics&mdash;handball principally&mdash;in recent years, as the result
      of a bad scare you got from a threatened paralytic attack; and your only
      serious illness since then has been typhoid fever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde laughed outright. &ldquo;If you had started our acquaintance
      that way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have thought you a
      fortune-teller. Part of it I can follow. You noticed that I kept my left
      ear turned, of course; and the fact that my nose shows no eyeglass marks
      would vouch for my eyesight. Did you judge me a non-smoker because I
      forgot to offer you a cigar&mdash;which deficiency I&rsquo;ll gladly make
      up now, if it isn&rsquo;t too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly that&mdash;no, thank you. I&rsquo;m not allowed to smoke&mdash;but
      principally because I noticed you disliked the odor of my hot milk. It is
      offensive, but so faint that no man without a very keen sense of smell
      would perceive it across a table; no tobacco-user preserves his sense of
      smell to any such degree of delicacy. As for the drink, I judged that from
      your eyes and general fitness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the handball, of course, from my &lsquo;cushioned&rsquo; palms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously. A man at the heart of a great business doesn&rsquo;t
      take up violent indoor exercise without some special reason. Such a reason
      I saw on the middle finger of your left hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding up the telltale member, Mr. Clyde disclosed a small dark area at
      the side of the first joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaky fountain-pen,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are right-handed naturally, but write with your left hand,
      it&rsquo;s clear that you&rsquo;ve had an attack of writer&rsquo;s
      paralysis&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years ago,&rdquo; put in Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that your doctor made good use of the salutary scare it gave
      you, to get you to take up regular exercise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, incidentally, to cut out my moderate, occasional cocktail.
      Now, as to the tropics and the typhoid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The latter is a guess; the former a certainty. Under your somewhat
      sparse long hair in front there is an outcropping of very fine hairs. Some
      special cause exists for that new growth. The most likely cause, at your
      age, is typhoid. As you&rsquo;ve kept in good training, it isn&rsquo;t
      likely that you&rsquo;d have had any other serious ailment recently. On
      that I took a chance. The small scars at the back of your ears could be
      nothing but the marks of that little pest of the tropics, the <i>bête
      rouge</i>. I&rsquo;ve had him dug out of my skin and I know something of
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right on every count,&rdquo; declared Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      given me cumulative proof of your value to me. I&rsquo;ll tell you. Forget
      formalities. Let me &lsquo;phone for a cab; we&rsquo;ll go to your hotel, get
      your things, and you come back with me for the night. In the morning you
      can look the ground over, and decide, with the human documents before you,
      whether you&rsquo;ll undertake the campaign.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man smiled a very pleasant and winning smile. &ldquo;You go
      fast,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And as in all fast motion, you create a
      current in your direction. Certainly, if I&rsquo;m to consider your
      remarkable plan I&rsquo;d best see the whole family. But there&rsquo;s one
      probable and perhaps insurmountable obstacle. Who is your physician?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t such a thing in the house, at present,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Clyde lightly. Then, in a graver tone, &ldquo;Our old family physician
      died six months ago. He knew us all inside and out as a man knows a
      familiar book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A difficult loss to replace. Knowledge of your patient is half the
      battle in medicine. You&rsquo;ve had no one since?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Six weeks ago, my third boy, Charley, showed signs of fever
      and we called a distant cousin of mine who has a large practice. He felt
      quite sure from the first that it was diphtheria; but he so managed
      matters that we had no trouble with the officials. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t
      report it at all, though I believe it was a very light case of the
      disease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;At the outset, I&rsquo;ll give
      you two bits of advice, gratis, Mr. Clyde. First, don&rsquo;t ever call
      your doctor-cousin again. He&rsquo;s an anarchist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what do you mean by that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain enough, isn&rsquo;t it? Anarchist, I said: a man
      who doesn&rsquo;t believe in law when it contravenes his convenience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde rubbed his chin again. &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Well!
      the second gift of advice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you either respect the law yourself or resign the presidency
      of the Public Health League.&rdquo; A distinct spot of red appeared on
      each of the elder man&rsquo;s smooth cheeks. &ldquo;Are you trying to
      provoke me to a quarrel?&rdquo; he asked brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his expression mollified. &ldquo;Or are you testing me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither. I&rsquo;m giving you my best and most honest advice. If
      you expect me to do as your substitute physician did, to guard your
      household in violation of the law which tries to protect the whole public
      equally, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong man, and your boasted judgment has
      gone askew,&rdquo; was the steady reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde turned and left the room. When he returned his hand was
      outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken three swallows of cold air, and sent for a cab,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;Shake hands. I think you and I will be friends. Only&mdash;train
      me a little gently at the outset. You&rsquo;ll come with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, and the two men shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the drive Mr. Clyde expounded the virtues and characteristics of
      his native city to his new acquaintance, who was an excellent listener.
      Long afterward he found Dr. Strong acting on remembered and shrewdly
      analyzed information given in that first long talk. When they reached the
      big, rambling, many-windowed house which afforded the growing Clyde family
      opportunity to grow, the head of the household took his guest to an
      apartment in one of the wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These two rooms are yours,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll
      be like Coleridge who came to visit with one satchel and stayed five
      years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be seen to-morrow,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;By
      the way, as I usually read myself to sleep, you might leave me some of
      your local health reports. Thus I can be looking the ground over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got you&rsquo;ll find on the shelf over the desk.
      Good-night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Being of that type of man who does his thinking before and not after a
      decision, Mr. Thomas Clyde arose in the morning with an untroubled mind as
      to his new venture in household economics. Voices from the library
      attracted him thither, as he came downstairs, and, entering, he beheld his
      guest hedged in a corner by the grandmother of the Clyde household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me, young man,&rdquo; the old lady was saying, in
      her clear, determined voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not slept well for ages!
      I know that kind of an eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Sharpless has been diagnosing my case, Mr. Clyde,&rdquo;
      called the guest, with a rather wry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay here for a while,&rdquo; said she vigorously, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
      cocker you up. I don&rsquo;t believe you even eat properly. Do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; admitted the young man. &ldquo;We doctors are
      sometimes less wise for ourselves than for others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! So you&rsquo;re a doctor?&rdquo; asked the grandmother with a
      shrewd, estimating glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Strong is, I hope, going to stay with us awhile,&rdquo;
      explained her son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take care
      of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strong inducement,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong gracefully.
      &ldquo;But I want a little more material on which to base a decision.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between us Grandma and I ought to be able to answer any questions,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About sickness, then, in the family. I&rsquo;ve already introduced
      myself to Mrs. Clyde and questioned her; but her information isn&rsquo;t
      definite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myra seldom is,&rdquo; observed Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part
      of her charm. But Grandma Sharpless has been keeping a daybook for years.
      Everything that&rsquo;s ever happened, from the cat&rsquo;s fits to the
      dressmaker&rsquo;s misfits, is in that series. I&rsquo;ve always thought
      it might come in handy sometime.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; said Dr. Strong heartily. &ldquo;Will you
      bring it, Mrs. Sharpless? I hope you&rsquo;ve included your comment on
      events as well as the events themselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinions are generally pronounced enough so that I can remember
      &lsquo;em, young man,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Sharpless, as she departed for
      the desired volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That last remark of yours sounded a little like making fun of
      Grandma,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Clyde, as the door closed after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; retorted Dr. Strong quickly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
      you see that she&rsquo;s a born diagnostician? She&rsquo;s got the sixth
      sense sticking out all over her. Women more often have it than men. When a
      doctor has it, and sometimes when he&rsquo;s only able to counterfeit it,
      he becomes great and famous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you speak of it, I remember my wife&rsquo;s saying that
      when she was a girl and lived in the country, her mother was always being
      sent for in cases of illness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong nodded. &ldquo;Heretical though it is to say so, I would rather
      have the diagnosis of such a woman, in an obscure case, than of many a
      doctor. She learns in the school of experience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, Mrs. Sharpless returned, carrying several diaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These go five years back,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find
      &lsquo;em pretty complete. We&rsquo;ve had our fair share of trouble;
      measles, whooping-cough,&mdash;I thought Betsy was going to bark her poor
      little head off,&mdash;mumps, and chicken-pox. I nursed &lsquo;em through,
      myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of &lsquo;em didn&rsquo;t have all the things because Tom Clyde
      sent the rest away when one of &lsquo;em came down. All nonsense, I say.
      Better let &lsquo;em get it while they&rsquo;re young, and have done with
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the worst of the old superstitions,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me, young man! Doctor or no doctor, you can&rsquo;t
      teach me about children&rsquo;s diseases. There isn&rsquo;t any of those
      measly and mumpy ones that I&rsquo;m afraid of. Bobs <i>did</i> scare me,
      though, with that queer attack of his.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobs,&rdquo; explained Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;is Robin, one of the
      eight-year-old twins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about the attack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When <i>was</i> it?&rdquo; said the grandmother, running over the
      leaves of a selected diary. &ldquo;Oh, here it is. Last March. It was
      short and sharp. Only lasted three days; but the child had a dreadful
      fever and pretty bad cramps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; though that idiot of a cousin of Tom&rsquo;s snubbed me
      when I told him about it. The boy seemed kind of numb and slow with his
      hands for some time after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; So sharp came the question that Mr. Clyde glanced
      at the speaker, not without apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing left of it that I can see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had you in mind?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde of the doctor,
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking technically, anterior poliomyelitis.&rdquo; Grandma
      Sharpless laughed comfortably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that a very long
      name like that usually means a sore toe or a pimple behind your ear. It&rsquo;s
      the short names that bring the undertaker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shrewdly said, but exception noted,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Bobs, I remember two cases I saw at Clinton years ago, like
      that attack of his. One of &lsquo;em never walked afterward, and the other
      has a shriveled hand to this day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong nodded. &ldquo;To come down nearer to English, that&rsquo;s
      infantile paralysis, one of the mysteries of medicine. I&rsquo;ll tell you
      some things about it some day. Your Bobs had a narrow escape.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it is an escape?&rdquo; asked the father
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mrs. Sharpless is satisfied that there&rsquo;s no trace left, I
      am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in to breakfast,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde, entering the room
      with a child attached to either hand. She was a tall, fair woman with the
      charm of fresh coloring and regular features, large, intelligent eyes, and
      a somewhat restless vigor and vitality. That her husband and children
      adored her was obvious. One had to look twice to perceive that she was
      over thirty; and even a careful estimate did not suggest her real age of
      thirty-seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the introductory meal, Dr. Strong talked mostly to her, but he kept
      watching the children. And when it was over, he went to his study and made
      an inventory, in the order of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      This catalogue Dr. Strong put away, with Grandma Sharpless&rsquo;s day
      books, for further notation and amplification. Then he made three visits:
      one to the Health Bureau, one to the Water Department, and one to the City
      Engineer&rsquo;s office, where he spent much time over sundry maps. It was
      close upon dinner-time when he returned, and immediately looked up Mr.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuming that I accept your offer it should be understood that I&rsquo;m
      only a guardian, not, a physician.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall expect, in emergency, to call in such physicians or
      others as I consider best equipped for the particular task.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. But why that phrase &lsquo;or others&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suggested before that I am a heretic. In certain
      instances I might want an osteopath, or, if I were dealing with a sick
      soul causing a sick body, I might even send for a Christian Scientist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a refreshingly catholic breadth of view.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to map out for you, a rich man, as good treatment
      as a very poor man would have in a hospital&mdash;that is, the best
      technical advice for every hygienic emergency that may arise&mdash;plus
      some few extensions of my own. Now we come to what is likely to prove the
      stumbling-block.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m to take this job, I must be the autocrat, in so far as
      my own department is concerned. As you know, a city health official&rsquo;s
      powers are arbitrary. He can burn your house down; he can imprison you; he
      can establish a military régime; he can override or undo the laws which
      control the ordinary procedure of life. Hygienic law, like martial law,
      supersedes rights in crises. You are asking me to act as health officer of
      your house. If I&rsquo;m to do my work, I must have full sway, and I shall
      expect you to see that every member of your household obeys my orders&mdash;except,&rdquo;
      he added, with a twinkle, &ldquo;Grandma Sharpless. I expect she&rsquo;s
      too old to take orders from any one. Diplomacy must be my agent with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde pondered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty wide authority you&rsquo;re
      asking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I shall use it only in extreme cases. I shall deal
      extensively in advice and suggestion, which you may take or leave as you
      choose. But an order will mean a life or death matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed. Now, as to terms&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the terms go, until we see how much I can save you. Meantime,
      don&rsquo;t overestimate what I undertake to do. Suppose you just run
      through the roster of what you consider the danger points, and I&rsquo;ll
      tell you how far I can promise anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, then, tuberculosis, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practical immunity from that, as long as you maintain your present
      standards of life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Typhoid fever. As I told you, we&rsquo;ve had one visitation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why you should ever have another if the
      children will take ordinary precautions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diphtheria?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t guarantee the youngsters against getting it, though
      we can do something to protect them. And if they do get it, we can be
      pretty certain of pulling them through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarlet fever and measles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not add whooping-cough and influenza? The former kills as many
      people as either scarlet fever or measles, and the latter twice as many.
      They&rsquo;re all in the same category; medical science is pretty near
      helpless against their onset. You and your family may be as rigidly
      careful as they will; if the family next door, or a family at the
      farthermost end of the town, is careless, we&rsquo;re as likely as not to
      suffer for their sins. All that I can promise, then, is hope against the
      occurrence of these diseases, and the constant watchfulness, when they
      come, which they call for but don&rsquo;t always get.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cancer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eternal vigilance, again; so that, if it does come, we may discover
      it in time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; mused Mr. Clyde; &ldquo;what else is there? Oh&mdash;nervous
      and functional disorders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Functional disorders mean, usually, either a bad start, or the
      heritage of some disease like scarlet fever or grippe, or excess or
      carelessness in living. I think your household is free from them; and it
      should remain free. As for nervous ailments, they commonly mean lack of
      self-discipline. It may be overindulgence in work&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced
      down at his right hand&mdash;&ldquo;or it may be overindulgence in play.&rdquo;
      His glance wandered significantly to the doorway, through which the voice
      of Mrs. Clyde could be heard. &ldquo;By the way, you&rsquo;ve left out the
      greatest destroyer of all&mdash;perhaps because you&rsquo;re beyond the
      danger point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tuberculosis is the greatest destroyer, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not numerically. It is beaten out by the death record of intestinal
      poisoning in the very young. Your flock has run the gamut and come through
      with undiminished vitality. Two of them, however, are running life&rsquo;s
      race under a handicap&rdquo;&mdash;the father&rsquo;s eyelids went up&mdash;&ldquo;which
      I&rsquo;ll take up shortly, when I&rsquo;ve fully determined the causes.
      They can be repaired, one readily, the other in time. Finally, I hope to
      be able to teach them the gospel of the sound, clean mind in the sound,
      clean body. In a desert I might guarantee immunity from most of the ills
      that flesh is heir to. Amid the complexities of our civilization, disease
      and death are largely social; there is no telling from what friend the
      poison may come. No man can safeguard his house. The most he can hope for
      is a measure of protection. I can offer you nothing more than that, under
      our compact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; returned Mr. Clyde. He took from his inner
      pocket a folded paper, which he handed over to the young man. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      the contract, duly signed. Come in, Grandma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sharpless, entering the door, stopped on seeing the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business, Tom?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business that you&rsquo;re interested in,&rdquo; said her
      son-in-law, and briefly outlined his plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Sharpless shook a wise gray head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re
      going to stay, young man,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You need looking after.
      But as for the scheme, I don&rsquo;t hold much with these new-fangled
      notions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t as new-fangled as you suppose,&rdquo;
      returned the head of the household. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just given Dr.
      Strong a contract, and where do you suppose I got it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lawyer man of yours, probably,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he looked it over and made sure it was sound in American law.
      But essentially it&rsquo;s a copy of a medical contract in force before
      Hippocrates ever rolled a pill. It&rsquo;s the old logical Chinese form,
      whereby the doctor&rsquo;s duty is prescribed as warding off sickness, not
      curing it. Is that old-fashioned enough for you, grandma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chinese! My land!&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;What do they
      know about sickness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know the one most important fact in all medical practice, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong, &ldquo;that the time for locking the stable door is
      before the horse is stolen, and that an ounce of prevention is worth a
      pound of cure.&rdquo;

      II.&mdash;IN TIME OF PEACE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;H</span>ow is the
      Chinese plan working?&rdquo; asked Mr. Thomas Clyde, stretching himself on
      the lounge in Dr. Strong&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      One week before, the doctor had been officially installed, on the Oriental
      principle of guarding the Clyde household against intruding sickness. In
      that time he had asked few questions. But Mr. Clyde, himself a close
      observer, noted the newcomer&rsquo;s quietly keen observation of the
      children, and sometimes of Mrs. Clyde, as they met at mealtime. He had
      remarked, too, that the nervous tension of the man was relaxing; and
      guessed that he had found, in his new and unique employment, something of
      that panacea of the troubled soul, congenial work. Now, having come to Dr.
      Strong&rsquo;s wing of the house by request, he smilingly put his
      question, and was as smilingly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Chinese physician has been making what the Chinese call a
      &lsquo;go-look-see.&rsquo; In other but less English terms, a reconnaissance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what department?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earth, air, and water.&rdquo; The other waved an inclusive hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any results?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all kinds. Preliminary report now ready. I&rsquo;d like to make
      it a sort of family conference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good idea! I&rsquo;ll send for Mrs. Clyde and Grandma Sharpless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children out of town?&rdquo; inquired Dr. Strong suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Oh, I see. You want us all. Servants, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cook certainly. She should be very important to our council of
      war. Perhaps we might leave the rest till later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They gathered in the spacious study; and Grandma Sharpless glanced round
      approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like family prayers,&rdquo; she commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Concerted effort <i>is</i> a sort of prayer, if it&rsquo;s honest,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had much of an opinion of
      the man who gets up in meeting to beg the Lord for sound health for
      himself and family and then goes home and sleeps with all his windows
      closed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no closed windows in this house,&rdquo; said Grandma
      Sharpless emphatically. &ldquo;I see to that, having been brought up on
      fresh air myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You show it,&rdquo; returned the doctor pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve noticed that this house breathes deep at night,
      through plenty of open windows. So I can save my own breath on that topic.
      Just now I want to talk milk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All our milk comes from my farm,&rdquo; said the head of the
      family. &ldquo;Cows are my hobby. You ought to see the place, Strong; it&rsquo;s
      only ten miles out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen the place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better get your milk somewhere else for a
      while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dr. Strong!&rdquo; protested Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
      a woman among my friends who doesn&rsquo;t envy me our cream. And the milk
      keeps sweet&mdash;oh, for days, doesn&rsquo;t it, Katie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; replied the cook. &ldquo;Three days, or even
      four, in the ice-box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that show it&rsquo;s pure?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong shook his head. &ldquo;Hardly proof,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Really
      clean milk will keep much longer. I have drunk milk from the Rochester
      municipal supply that was thirteen days old, and as sweet as possible. And
      that was in a hot August.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirteen days old! I&rsquo;d be ashamed to tell it!&rdquo; declared
      Grandma Sharpless, with so much asperity that there was a general laugh,
      in which the doctor joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care to try it with your milk. It is rich, but it
      isn&rsquo;t by any means pure. Eternal vigilance is the price of good
      milk. I don&rsquo;t suppose you inspect your farm once a month, do you,
      Mr. Clyde?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I leave that to the farmer. He&rsquo;s an intelligent fellow.
      What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scientifically speaking, from 300,000 to 500,000 bacteria per cubic
      centimeter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we drink all those things when we have a glass of milk, Dr.
      Strong?&rdquo; inquired &ldquo;Manny&rdquo; Clyde, the oldest boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four or five times that many for every teaspoonful,&rdquo; said the
      doctor. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t as bad as it sounds, Manny. One hundred
      thousand is considered a fairly safe allowance, though <i>very</i> good
      milk&mdash;the kind I drank when it was thirteen days old&mdash;may
      contain only two or three thousand. When the count runs up to half a
      million or so, it shows that some kind of impurity is getting in. The
      bacteria in your milk may not be disease germs at all; they may all be
      quite harmless varieties. But sooner or later, if dirt gets into milk,
      dangerous germs will get in with it. The high count is a good danger
      signal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Bliss, the farmer, has been allowing dirt to get into the milk,
      he&rsquo;ll find himself out of a place,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on him,&rdquo; advised the doctor. &ldquo;His
      principal fault is that he&rsquo;s getting the milk dirty trying to keep
      it clean. He is washing his cans with water from an open well near the
      barnyard. The water in the well is badly contaminated from surface
      drainage. That would account for the high number of bacteria; that and
      careless milking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on that account you advise me to give up the milk?&rdquo; asked
      Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only temporarily. There are other more immediate considerations.
      For one thing, there are both diphtheria and typhoid near by, and the
      people on the farm are in contact with them. That&rsquo;s dangerous. You
      see, milk under favorable conditions is one of the best cultures for germs
      that is known. They flourish and multiply in it past belief. The merest
      touch of contamination may spread through a whole supply, like fire
      through flax. One more thing: one of your cows, I fear, is tuberculous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might pasteurize, I suppose,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Clyde
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong returned a decisive negative. &ldquo;Pasteurized milk is better
      than poisoned milk,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a lot worse than
      good raw milk. Pasteurizing simply means the semi-cooking of all the
      varieties of germs, good and bad. In the process of cooking, some of the
      nutritive quality is lost. To be sure, it kills the bad germs, but it also
      kills the good ones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that some of the germs are actually useful?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very useful, in certain rôles. For example, the lactic acid
      bacteria would be unpopular with you, Mrs. Clyde, because they are
      responsible for the souring of milk. But they also perform a protective
      work. They do their best to destroy any bacilli of disease which may
      invade their liquid home. Now, when you pasteurize, you kill all these
      millions of defenders; and any hostile germs that come along afterward and
      get into the milk, through dust or other mediums, can take possession and
      multiply without hindrance. Therefore pasteurized milk ought to be guarded
      with extra care after the process, which it seldom is. I once visited a
      large pasteurizing plant which made great boasts of its purity of product,
      and saw flies coming in from garbage pail and manure heap to contaminate
      the milk in the vats; milk helpless to protect itself, because all its
      army of defense had been boiled to death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are allowed neither to use our farm milk raw nor to
      pasteurize it, what shall we do with it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full directions are in there,&rdquo; answered Dr. Strong, pointing
      to an envelope on his desk. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll look over what I&rsquo;ve
      written, and instruct your farmer to follow it out, you&rsquo;ll have milk
      that is reasonably good. I&rsquo;ll go further than that; it will be even
      good enough to give to the babies of the tenements, if you should have any
      left over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thomas Clyde proceeded to rub his chin, with some degree of
      concentration, whereby Dr. Strong knew that his hint had struck in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde, with a trace of sarcasm, &ldquo;do
      you expect us to live on condensed milk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; on certified milk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mean?&rdquo; asked Miss Julia, who had a thirst
      for information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a certificate, Junkum?&rdquo; retorted the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I get when I pass my examinations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! Well, milk coming from a farm that passes all its
      examinations gets a certificate from the Medical Society, which keeps a
      pretty constant watch over it. The society sees that all the cattle are
      tested for tuberculosis once in so often; that the cows are brushed off
      before milking; that the milking is done through a cloth, through which no
      dirt or dust can pass, into a can that has been cleaned by steam&mdash;not
      by contaminated water&mdash;so that no germs will remain alive in it; then
      cooled and sealed up and delivered. From the time the milk leaves the cow
      until it comes on your table, it hasn&rsquo;t touched anything that isn&rsquo;t
      germ-proof. That is the system I have outlined in the paper for your
      farmer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds expensive,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is the drawback. Certified milk costs from fifteen to
      twenty cents a quart. But when you consider that nearly half the dead
      babies were poisoned by bad milk it doesn&rsquo;t seem so expensive, does
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All very well for us,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde thoughtfully. &ldquo;We
      can afford it. But how about the thousands who can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the pity of it. Theoretically every city should
      maintain a milk standard up to the requirements of the medical
      certification, and allow no milk to be sold which falls short of that. It&rsquo;s
      feasible, and it could be done at a moderate price if we could educate the
      farmer to it. Copenhagen&rsquo;s milk supply is as good as the best
      certified milk in this country, because the great Danish Milk Company
      cooperates with the farmer, and doesn&rsquo;t try to make huge profits;
      and its product sells under five cents a quart. But, to answer your
      question, Mr. Clyde: even a family of very moderate means could afford to
      take enough certified milk for the baby, and it would pay in doctor&rsquo;s
      bills saved. Older children and grown-ups aren&rsquo;t so much affected by
      milk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out to the farm to-morrow,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water, Mr. Clyde. I&rsquo;ve found out where you got your typhoid,
      last summer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! I could have told you that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless.
      &ldquo;There was sewer-gas in the house. It smelled to heaven the day
      before he was taken down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it curious how our belief in ghosts sticks to us!&rdquo;
      commented the doctor, chuckling,&mdash;&ldquo;malaria rising from swamps;
      typhoid and diphtheria rising in sewer-gas; sheeted specters rising from
      country graveyards&mdash;all in the same category.&rdquo; Grandma
      Sharpless pushed her spectacles up on her forehead, a signal of battle
      with her. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, young man, that there&rsquo;s no
      harm in sewer-gas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it! There&rsquo;s harm enough in sewer-gas, but no germs.
      The harm is that the gas reduces vitality, and makes one more liable to
      disease attack. It&rsquo;s just as true of coal-gas as of sewer-gas, and
      more true of ordinary illuminating gas than either. I&rsquo;d much rather
      have bad plumbing in the house than even a small leak in a gas-pipe. No,
      Mrs. Sharpless, if you waited all day at the mouth of a sewer, you&rsquo;d
      never catch a germ from the gas. Moreover, typhoid doesn&rsquo;t develop
      under ten days, so your odorous outbreak of the day before could have had
      nothing to do with Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s illness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll give us <i>your</i> theory,&rdquo; said the
      old lady, with an elaboration of politeness which plainly meant, &ldquo;And
      whatever it is, I don&rsquo;t propose to believe it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mine, but the City Water Commissioner&rsquo;s. Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s
      case was one of about eighty, all within a few weeks of each other. They
      were all due to the criminal negligence of a city official who permitted
      the river supply, which isn&rsquo;t fit to drink and is used only for fire
      pressure, to flood into the mains carrying the drinking supply.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t the whole city get typhoid?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because only a part of the system was flooded by the river water.
      The problem of the city&rsquo;s experts was to find out what part was
      being contaminated with this dilute sewage. When the typhoid began to
      appear, the Health Department, knowing the Cypress supply to be pure,
      suspected milk. Not until a score of cases, showing a distribution
      distinct from any milk supply, had appeared, was suspicion directed to the
      water supply. Then the officials of the Water Department and Health
      Department tried a very simple but highly ingenious test. They dumped a
      lot of salt into the intake of the river supply, and tested hydrant after
      hydrant of the reservoir supply, until they had a complete outline of the
      mixed waters. From that it was easy to ascertain the point of mixture, and
      stop it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our river water is always bad, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Clyde. &ldquo;Last summer I had to keep Charley away from swimming-school
      because the tank is filled from the river, and two children got typhoid
      from swallowing some of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All foolishness, I say,&rdquo; announced the grandmother. &ldquo;Better
      let &lsquo;em learn to swim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you swim at all?&rdquo; asked Dr. Strong, turning to
      the seven-year-old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went five strokes once,&rdquo; said Charley. &ldquo;Hum-m-m! Any
      other swimming-school near by?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are the children about water at all?&rdquo; Dr. Strong asked
      the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; there are the canal and the river both near us, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it comes down to this,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;The
      liability of typhoid from what water Charley would swallow in the tank isn&rsquo;t
      very great. And if he should get it, the chances are we could pull him
      through. With the best care, there should be only one chance in fifty of a
      fatal result. But if Charley falls in the canal and, not knowing how to
      swim, is drowned, why, that&rsquo;s the end of it. Medical science is no
      good there. Of two dangers choose the lesser. Better let him go on with
      the swimming, Mrs. Clyde.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;swanny!&rdquo;
      This was extreme profanity for her. &ldquo;Young man, I&rsquo;m glad to
      see for once that you&rsquo;ve got sense as well as science!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you consider the Cypress supply always safe to drink? Several
      times it has occurred to me to outfit the house with filters,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need, so long as the present Water Department is in office,&rdquo;
      returned Dr. Strong. &ldquo;I might almost add, no use anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t filtered water good?&rdquo; asked Manny. &ldquo;They
      have it at the gymnasium.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No house filter is absolutely sure. There&rsquo;s just one way to
      get a guaranteeable water: distill it. But I think you can safely use the
      city supply.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next, the water problem being cleared up?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means cleared up. Assuming that you are reasonably
      safeguarded at home, you&rsquo;re just as likely&mdash;yes, even more
      likely&mdash;to pick up typhoid somewhere else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why more likely?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some mysterious reason a man accustomed to a good water supply
      is the easiest victim to a bad. Pittsburg, for many years the most
      notorious of American cities for filthy drinking, is a case in point. Some
      one pointed out that when Pittsburg was prosperous, and wages high, the
      typhoid rate went up; and when times were hard, it went down. Dr. Matson,
      of the Health Bureau, cleared up that point, by showing that the increase
      in Pittsburg&rsquo;s favorite disease was mainly among the newcomers who
      flocked to the city when the mills were running full time, to fill the
      demand for labor. An old resident might escape, a new one might hardly
      hope to. Dr. Matson made the interesting suggestion that perhaps those who
      drank the diluted sewage&mdash;for that is what the river water was&mdash;right
      along, came, in time, to develop a sort of immunity; whereas the newcomer
      was defenseless before the bacilli.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then a man, in traveling, ought to know the water supply of every
      city he goes to. How is he to find out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your case, Mr. Clyde, he&rsquo;s to find out from his Chinese
      doctor,&rdquo; said the other smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m collecting data
      from state and city health boards, on that and other points. Air will now
      come in for its share of attention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Manny Clyde grinned. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use, Dr. Strong?&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;Nothing to breathe but air, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough, youngster; but you can pick your air to some extent,
      so it&rsquo;s worth while to know where it&rsquo;s good and where it&rsquo;s
      bad. Take Chicago, for instance. It has a very high pneumonia rate, and no
      wonder! The air there is a whirling mass of soot. After breathing that
      stuff a while, the lungs lose something of their power to resist, and the
      pneumococcus bacillus&mdash;that&rsquo;s the little fellow that brings
      pneumonia and is always hanging about, looking for an opening in
      unprotected breathing apparatus&mdash;gets in his deadly work. Somewhere I&rsquo;ve
      seen it stated that one railroad alone which runs through Chicago deposits
      more than a ton of cinders per year on every acre of ground bordering on
      its track. Now, no man can breathe that kind of an atmosphere and not feel
      the evil effects. Pittsburg is as bad, and Cincinnati and Cleveland aren&rsquo;t
      much better. We save on hard coal and smoke-consumers, and lose in disease
      and human life, in our soft-coal cities. When I go to any of them I pick
      the topmost room in the highest hotel I can find, and thus get above the
      worst of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that New York is unfit to breathe in!&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Clyde, with a woman&rsquo;s love for the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus far it&rsquo;s pretty clean. The worst thing about New York is
      that they dry-sweep their streets and throw all the dust there is right in
      your face. The next worst is the subway. When analysis was made of the
      tube&rsquo;s air, the experimenters were surprised to find very few germs.
      But they were shocked to find the atmosphere full of tiny splinters of
      steel. It&rsquo;s even worse to breathe steel than to breathe coal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any railroad track must be bad, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily. A steam railroad track runs mostly in the open,
      and that great cleaner, the wind, takes care of most of the trouble it
      stirs up. By the way, the cheaper you travel, the better you travel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds like one of those maxims of the many that only the few
      believe,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t practice it, but you can safely believe it,&rdquo;
      retorted the doctor. &ldquo;The atmosphere in a day coach is always better
      than in a parlor car, because there&rsquo;s an occasional direct draft
      through. As for a sleeping-car,&mdash;well, I never get into one without
      thinking of the definition in &lsquo;Life&rsquo;s&rsquo; dictionary:
      &lsquo;Sleeping-Car&mdash;An invention for the purpose of transporting bad
      air from one city to another.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor railroads!&rdquo; chuckled Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;They get
      blamed for everything, nowadays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be the Pullman Company&rsquo;s fault that I don&rsquo;t
      sleep well in traveling, but they are certainly to blame for clinging to a
      type of conveyance specially constructed for the encouragement of dirt and
      disease. Look at the modern sleeping-car: heavy plush seats; soft
      hangings; thick carpets; fripperies and fopperies all as gorgeous, vulgar,
      expensive, tawdry, and filthy as the mind of man can devise. Add to that,
      windows hermetically sealed in the winter months and you&rsquo;ve got an
      ideal contrivance for the encouragement of mortality. Never do I board a
      sleeper without a stout hickory stick in my suit-case. No matter how low
      the temperature is, I pry the window of my lower berth open, and push the
      stick under.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sleep in that cold draft!&rdquo; cried Mrs Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Clyde,&rdquo; replied the doctor suavely, &ldquo;will
      you tell me the difference between a draft and a wind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a conundrum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;ll answer it for you. A draft is inside a house; a
      wind outside. You&rsquo;re not afraid of wind, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then to you an air-current is like a burglar. It&rsquo;s harmless
      enough outside the room, but as soon as it comes through a window and gets
      into the room, it&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sound common sense!&rdquo; put in Granny Sharpless. &ldquo;Young
      man, I believe you&rsquo;re older than you look.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old enough to know that pure air is better than foul warm
      air, anyway. Here; I want you youngsters to understand this,&rdquo; he
      added, turning to the children. &ldquo;When the blood has circulated
      through the system, doing all the work, it gets tired out and weak. Then
      the lungs bring air to it to freshen it up, and the oxygen in the air
      makes it strong to fight against disease and cold. But if the air is bad,
      the blood becomes half starved. So the man who breathes stuffy, close air
      all night hasn&rsquo;t given his blood the right supply. His whole system
      is weakened, and he &lsquo;catches cold,&rsquo; not from too much air, but
      too little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s often struck me,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;that I
      feel better traveling in Europe than in America. Yet our Pullmans are
      supposed to be the best in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst!&rdquo; declared Dr. Strong forcefully. &ldquo;The best
      in luxuries, the worst in necessities. The only real good and fairly
      sanitary cars operated by the Pullman Company, outside of the high-priced
      stateroom variety, are the second class transcontinentals, the tourist
      cars. They have straw seats instead of plush; light hangings, and, as a
      rule, good ventilation. If I go to the Pacific Coast again, it will be
      that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, in which rose the clear whisper of Bobs, appealing to
      his mentor, Julia, for information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Junkum, how did we get so far away from home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High time we came back, isn&rsquo;t it, Bobs?&rdquo; approved the
      doctor. &ldquo;Well, suppose we return by way of the school-house. All of
      you go to Number Three but Betsey, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m go-un next year,&rdquo; announced that young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,
      Doctor, that children are liable to catch all sorts of things in the
      public schools?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More so than in private schools, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Well, yes; since they&rsquo;re brought into contact with a
      more miscellaneous lot of comrades.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is exactly why I have insisted on our sticking to the regular
      schools,&rdquo; put in Mr. Clyde, with the air of quiet decisiveness.
      &ldquo;I want our children to be brought up like other children!&rdquo;
      The mother shook her head dubiously. &ldquo;I wish I were sure it is the
      right place for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be sure. I might even say&mdash;if you will forgive
      the implied criticism&mdash;that you ought to be surer than you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed at his tone, the mother leaned forward. &ldquo;Is there anything
      the matter at Number Three?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several things. Nothing that you need worry about immediately,
      however. I&rsquo;ve been talking with some of the teachers, and found out
      a few points. Charley&rsquo;s teacher, for instance, tells me that she has
      a much harder time keeping the children up to their work in the winter
      term than at other times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember Charley&rsquo;s tantrums over his arithmetic, last
      winter,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head felt funny. Kinder thick,&rdquo; defended Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is bad,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, &ldquo;very bad. I&rsquo;ve
      reported the teacher in that grade to Dr. Merritt, the Health Officer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reported teacher?&rdquo; said Charley, his eyes assuming a
      prominence quite startling. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starving her grade.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clyde fairly bounced in her chair. &ldquo;Our children are not
      supposed to eat at school, Dr. Strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starving her grade,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;in the most
      important need of the human organism, air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you reach that conclusion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidence and experience. I remember in my college days that the
      winter term was considered to be the most difficult in every year. The
      curriculum didn&rsquo;t seem to show it, but every professor and every
      undergraduate knew it. Bad air, that&rsquo;s all. The recitation rooms
      were kept tightly closed. The human brain can&rsquo;t burn carbon and get
      a bright flame of intelligence without a good draft, and the breathing is
      the draft. Now, on the evidence of Charley&rsquo;s teacher, when winter
      comes percentages go down, although the lessons are the same. So I asked
      her about the ventilation and found that she had a superstitious dread of
      cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember Miss Benn&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said Julia thoughtfully.
      &ldquo;It used to get awful hot there. I never liked that grade anyway,
      and Bobs got such bad deportment marks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of the twins had colds all the winter they were in that room,&rdquo;
      contributed Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up went Dr. Strong&rsquo;s hands, the long fingers doubled in, in a
      curious gesture which only stress of feeling ever drove him to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When will the substitute mothers and fathers who run our
      schools learn about air!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Air! It&rsquo;s the first
      cry of the newly born baby. Air! It&rsquo;s the last plea of the man with
      the death-rattle in his throat. It&rsquo;s the one free boon, and we shut
      it out. If I&rsquo;m here next winter, I think I&rsquo;ll load up with
      stones and break some windows!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme go with you!&rdquo; cried Charley, with the eagerness of
      destruction proper to seven years. &ldquo;On the whole, Charley,&rdquo;
      replied the other, chuckling a little, &ldquo;perhaps it&rsquo;s better to
      smash traditions. Not easier, but better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t have them study with all the windows open on
      a zero day!&rdquo; protested Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I! Far rather than choke them in a close room! Why,
      in Chicago, the sickly children have special classes on the roof, or in
      the yards, all through the cold weather. They study in overcoats and
      mittens. And they <i>learn</i>. Not only that, but they thrive on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde was rubbing his chin hard. &ldquo;Perhaps our school system isn&rsquo;t
      all I bragged,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in all respects. You still stick to that relic of barbarism,
      the common drinking-cup, after filtering your water. That&rsquo;s a joke!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the point,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Whom
      is the joke on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of you who pay for the useless filters and then settle doctors&rsquo;
      bills for the disease spread by the drinking-cups. Don&rsquo;t you
      understand that in the common contagious diseases, the mouth is the danger
      point? Now, you may filter water till it&rsquo;s dry, but if in drinking
      it you put your lips to a cup soiled by the touch of diseased lips, you&rsquo;re
      in danger. We think too much of the water and too little of what contains
      it. I&rsquo;ve seen a school in Auburn, New York, and I&rsquo;ve seen a
      golf course at the Country Club in Seattle, where there isn&rsquo;t a
      glass or cup to be found; and they have two of the best water supplies I
      know. A tiny fountain spouts up to meet your lips, and your mouth touches
      nothing but the running water. The water itself being pure, you can&rsquo;t
      possibly get any infection from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get me a report on that for the Board of Education?&rdquo;
      asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s already here,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong quietly. &ldquo;That
      is part of my Chinese job of watch-dog. One other matter. A teacher in
      another grade, at Number Three, with whom I talked, stood with a pencil,
      which she had taken from one of her scholars, pressed to her lips. While
      we talked she gave it back to the child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, land sakes!&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s
      the harm? I suppose the poor girl was clean, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? How does anybody know? There is a case on record
      where a teacher carried the virulent bacilli of diphtheria in her throat
      for three months. Suppose she had been careless about putting her lips to
      the various belongings of the children. How many of them do you suppose
      she would have killed with the deadly poison?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she know she had diphtheria?&rdquo; asked Junkum,
      wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t, dear. She was what we call a &lsquo;carrier&rsquo;
      of disease. For some reason which we can&rsquo;t find out, a &lsquo;carrier&rsquo;
      doesn&rsquo;t fall ill, but will give the disease to any one else as
      surely as a very sick person, if the germs from the throat reach the
      throat or lips of others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some lectures on hygiene might not be amiss in Number Three,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what medical school inspectors are for&mdash;to teach
      the teachers. The Board of Education should be getting it started.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing over there, Twinkles?&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde to
      Bettina, who had slipped from his knee and was sliding her chubby fist
      along the window-pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child looked around. &ldquo;Thwat that fly,&rdquo; she explained with
      perfect seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has heard the other children talking about the fly-leaflets
      that have been scattered around. Where&rsquo;s the fly, Toodles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up they-arr,&rdquo; replied Bettina, pointing to a far corner of
      the pane where a big &ldquo;green-bottle&rdquo; bumped its head against
      the glass. &ldquo;Come down, buzzy fly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, where,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Clyde, in despair, &ldquo;do you
      suppose that wretched creature came from? I&rsquo;m so particular always
      to keep the rooms screened and darkened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&rsquo;m, it might have come from the kitchen,&rdquo;
      suggested Katie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a plenty of &lsquo;em there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And before that it came from your next-door neighbor&rsquo;s
      manure-heap,&rdquo; added Dr. Strong. &ldquo;That particular kind of fly
      breeds only in manure. The fact is that the fly is about the nastiest
      thing alive. Compared to it, a hog is a gentleman, and a vulture an
      epicure. It loves filth, and unhappily, it also loves clean, household
      foods. Therefore the path of its feet is direct between the two&mdash;from
      your neighbor&rsquo;s stable-yard to your dinner-table.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than disgusting: dangerous,&rdquo; returned Dr. Strong,
      unmoved by her distaste. &ldquo;A fly&rsquo;s feet are more than likely to
      be covered with disease-bearing matter, which he leaves behind him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something ought to be done about Freeman&rsquo;s manure-heap, next
      door. I&rsquo;ll see to it,&rdquo; announced Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless you could report him for maintaining a nuisance,&rdquo;
      admitted Dr. Strong; &ldquo;in which case he might&mdash;er&mdash;conceivably
      retort upon you with your unscreened garbage-pails, which are hatcheries
      for another variety of fly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a beam in the eye for you, Tom,&rdquo; said Grandma
      Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime I&rsquo;ll have the kitchen windows and doors screened at
      once,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will help,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, &ldquo;though it won&rsquo;t
      cure. You can gain some idea, from this matter of the flies, how intricate
      a social problem health really is. No man sins to himself alone, in
      hygiene, and no man can thoroughly protect himself against the misdeeds of
      his neighbor. It&rsquo;s true that there is such a thing as individual
      self-defense by a sort of personal fortifying of the body&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      take that up some other time&mdash;but it&rsquo;s very limited. You can
      carry the fight into the enemy&rsquo;s country and eradicate the evil
      conditions that threaten all, only by identifying yourself with your
      environment, and waging war on that basis. Mr. Clyde, do you know anything
      about the row of wooden tenements in the adjoining alley?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saddler&rsquo;s Shacks? Not much, except that a lot of Italians
      live there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some live; some die. The whole settlement is a scandal of
      overcrowding, dirt, and disease. I&rsquo;ve made out a little local health
      report of the place, for the year. Of course, it&rsquo;s incomplete; but
      it&rsquo;s significant. Look it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde read aloud as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; asked Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad showing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad showing and a bad property. Why don&rsquo;t you
      buy it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? I? Are you advising me to buy a job-lot of diseases?&rdquo;
      queried Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;as a protective investment. We&rsquo;d be safe here if
      those tenements were run differently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we aren&rsquo;t in touch with them at all. They are around the
      corner on another block.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, visitors pass daily between your house and Saddler&rsquo;s
      Shacks. One of the young men from there delivers bread, often with his
      bare and probably filthy hands. Two of the women peddle fruit about the
      neighborhood. What Saddler&rsquo;s Shacks get in the way of disease, you
      may easily get by transmission from them. Further, the sanitary
      arrangements of the shacks are primitive, not to say prehistoric, and,
      incidentally, illegal. They are within the area of fly-travel from here,
      so both the human and the winged disease-bearers have the best possible
      opportunity to pick up infection in its worst form.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never eat with a
      fly again as long as I live!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a simple matter to have the Bureau of Health
      condemn the property?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not.&rdquo; Dr. Strong spoke with curt emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain features, you said, are illegal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But pull is still stronger than law in this city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who owns Saddler&rsquo;s Shacks?&rdquo; asked Grandma Sharpless,
      going with characteristic directness to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Carson Searle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; asserted Mrs. Clyde.
      &ldquo;I know Mrs. Searle very well. She&rsquo;s a leader in church and
      charitable work. Of course, she doesn&rsquo;t know about the condition of
      the property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows enough about it,&rdquo; retorted Dr. Strong grimly,
      &ldquo;to go to the Mayor over the Health Officer&rsquo;s head, and put a
      stop to Dr. Merritt&rsquo;s order for the premises to be cleaned up at the
      owner&rsquo;s expense. She wants her profits undisturbed. And now, before
      the conference breaks up, I propose that we organize the Household
      Protective Association.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, can we children belong?&rdquo; cried Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. There are offices and honors enough for all. Mr. Clyde
      shall be president; Mrs. Sharpless, vice-president and secretary; Mrs.
      Clyde, treasurer, and each one of the rest of you shall have a committee.
      Katie, I appoint you chairman of the Committee on Food, and if any more
      flies get into your kitchen, you can report &lsquo;em to the Committee on
      Flies, Miss Bettina Clyde, chairman; motto, &lsquo;Thwat that fly!&rsquo;
      Manny, you like to go to the farm; you get the Committee on Milk Supply.
      Junkum, your committee shall be that of school conditions. Bobs, water is
      your element. As Water Commissioner you must keep watch on the city
      reports. I&rsquo;ll see that they are sent you regularly; and the typhoid
      records.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t left anything for me,&rdquo; protested Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I! You&rsquo;ve got one of the biggest of all jobs,
      air. If the windows aren&rsquo;t properly wide when the house is asleep, I
      want to know it from you, and you&rsquo;ll have to get up early to find
      out. If the Street Cleaning Department sweeps the air full of dust because
      it&rsquo;s too lazy to wash down the roadway first, we&rsquo;ll make a
      committee report to the Mayor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bettina, <i>alias</i> Toots, <i>alias</i> Twinkles, <i>alias</i> the
      Cherub, trotted oyer and laid two plump hands on the doctor&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to be anyfing in the play?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Of course, Toots. Every real
      association has to have officers and membership, you know. I&rsquo;m the
      Member.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;M</span>edicine
      would be the ideal profession if it did not involve giving pain,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong, setting a paper-weight upon some school reports which had
      just come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been here three months and you haven&rsquo;t hurt any
      one yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve been cautious, and perhaps a little cowardly. My
      place as Chinese doctor has been such a sinecure that I&rsquo;ve let
      things go. Moreover, I&rsquo;ve wanted to gain Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s
      confidence as much as possible, before coming to the point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s keen, good-humored face altered and
      focused sharply. He scrutinized the doctor in silence. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s
      have it,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;Is it my wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s Bettina.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The father winced. &ldquo;That baby!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Serious?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, quite simple. <i>If</i> it is handled wisely. But
      it means&mdash;pain. Not a great deal; but still, pain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An operation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong nodded. &ldquo;Merely a minor one. I&rsquo;ve sounded Mrs.
      Clyde, without her knowing it, and she will oppose it. Mrs. Sharpless,
      too, I fear. You know how women dread suffering for the children they
      love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Clyde winced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s necessary, of
      course,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to do it would be both stupid and cruel. Shall we call in the
      women and have it out with them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For reply, Mr. Clyde pressed a button and sent the servant who responded,
      for Mrs. Clyde and her mother. Grandma Sharpless arrived first, took stock
      of the men&rsquo;s grave faces, and sat down silently, folding her strong,
      competent hands in her lap. But no sooner had Mrs. Clyde caught sight of
      her husband&rsquo;s face than her hand went to her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The children&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to be alarmed about, Mrs. Clyde,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong
      quickly. He pushed a chair toward her. &ldquo;Sit down. It&rsquo;s a
      question of&mdash;of what I might call carpenter-work&rdquo;&mdash;the
      mother laughed a nervous relief&mdash;&ldquo;on Betty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty?&rdquo; Her fears fluttered in her voice. &ldquo;What about
      Betty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She needs repairing; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean! Is she hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. She is breathing wrong. She breathes through her mouth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; There was reassurance and a measure even of contempt in
      Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Lots of children do that. Perhaps she&rsquo;s
      got a little cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that. This is no new thing with her. She is a
      mouth-breather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s corrected,&rdquo; promised the
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one thing can correct it,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong gravely.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a difficulty that must be removed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean an operation? On that baby? Do you know that she isn&rsquo;t
      five yet? And you want to cut her with a knife&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Myra,&rdquo; came Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s full, even speech.
      &ldquo;Dr. Strong doesn&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to do anything except what he
      considers necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessary! Supposing she does breathe through her mouth! What
      excuse is that for torturing her&mdash;my baby!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer that, Mrs. Clyde,&rdquo; said the doctor, with
      patient politeness. Walking over to the window he threw it up and called,
      &ldquo;Oh, Tootles! Twinkles! Honorable Miss Cherub, come up here. I&rsquo;ve
      got something to show you.&rdquo; And presently in came the child,
      dragging a huge and dilapidated doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a picture of rosy health, but, for the first time, the mother
      noted the drooping of the lower jaw, and the slight lift of the upper lip,
      revealing the edges of two pearly teeth. Dr. Strong took from a drawer a
      little wooden box, adjusted a lever and, placing the ear pieces in Betty&rsquo;s
      ears, bade her listen. But the child shook her head. Again he adjusted the
      indicator. This time, too, she said that she heard nothing. Not until the
      fourth change did she announce delightedly that she heard a pretty bell,
      but that it sounded very far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll try it on mother,&rdquo; said the experimenter, and
      added in a low tone as he handed it to Mrs. Clyde, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve set
      it two points less loud than Betty&rsquo;s mark. Can you hear it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clyde nodded. A look of dread came into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Tootles, open your mouth,&rdquo; directed the doctor,
      producing a little oblong metal contrivance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any sore froat,&rdquo; objected the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I want to look at the thoughts inside your head,&rdquo; he
      explained mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      With entire confidence the child opened her mouth as wide as possible, and
      Dr. Strong, setting the instrument far back against her tongue, applied
      his eye to the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Toots,&rdquo; he said, after a moment. &ldquo;Get your
      breath, and then let mother look.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed Mrs. Clyde how to press the tiny button setting aglow an
      electric lamp and lighting up the nasal passages above the throat, which
      were reflected on a mirror within the contrivance and thus made clear to
      the eye. Following his instructions, she set her eye to the miniature
      telescope as the physician pressed it against the little tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Betty,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, as the implement was again
      withdrawn, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got very nice thoughts inside that wise
      little head of yours. Now you can continue bringing up your doll in the
      way she should go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed behind her the mother turned to Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she going to be deaf?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he reassured her. &ldquo;That will be taken
      care of. What did you see above the back of the throat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little things like tiny stalactites hanging down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adenoids.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where could she have gotten adenoids?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From her remotest imaginable ancestor, probably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, aren&rsquo;t they a disease?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. An inheritance. The race has always had them. Probably they&rsquo;re
      vestigial salivary glands, the use of which we&rsquo;ve outgrown.
      Unfortunately they may overdevelop and block up the air-passages. Then
      they have to come out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in the conference Grandma Sharpless gathered force and
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; she said solemnly&mdash;rather accusingly, in
      fact&mdash;&ldquo;if the Lord put adenoids in the human nose he put
      &lsquo;em there for some purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless. But that purpose, whatever it may have been, no longer
      exists.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything in the human body has some use,&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had,&rdquo; corrected Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Not has. How about your
      appendix?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sharpless&rsquo;s appendix, like the wicked, had long since ceased
      from troubling, and was now at rest in alcohol in a doctor&rsquo;s office,
      having, previous to the change of location, given its original
      proprietress the one bad scare of her life. Therefore, she blinked, not
      being provided with a ready answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ancestors of man,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, &ldquo;were endowed
      with sundry organs, like the appendix and the adenoids, which civilized
      man is better off without. And, as civilized man possesses a God-given
      intelligence to tell him how to get rid of them, he wisely does so when it&rsquo;s
      necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have the adenoids to do with Betty&rsquo;s deafness?&rdquo;
      asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. They divert the air-currents, thicken the tubes
      connecting throat and ear, and interfere with the hearing. Don&rsquo;t let
      that little deficiency in keenness of ear bother you, though. Most likely
      it will pass with the removal of the adenoids. Even if it shouldn&rsquo;t,
      it is too slight to be a handicap. But I want the child to be repaired
      before any of the familiar and more serious adenoid difficulties are fixed
      on her for life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there others?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, every imaginable kind. How could it be otherwise? Here&rsquo;s
      the very first principle of life, the breath, being diverted from its
      proper course, in the mouth-breather; isn&rsquo;t a general derangement of
      functions the inevitable result? The hearing is affected, as I&rsquo;ve
      shown you already. The body doesn&rsquo;t get its proper amount of oxygen,
      and the digestion suffers. The lungs draw their air-supply in the wrong
      way, and the lung capacity is diminished. The open mouth admits all kinds
      of dust particles which inflame the throat and make it hospitable to
      infection. By incorrect breathing the facial aspect of the mouth-breather
      is variously modified and always for the worse; since the soft facial
      bones of youth are altered by the continual striking of an air-current on
      the roof of the mouth, which is pushed upward, distorting the whole face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of <i>our</i> children are distorted. You won&rsquo;t find a
      better-looking lot anywhere,&rdquo; challenged Mrs. Sharpless, the
      grandmother&rsquo;s pride up in arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. None of them has had overdeveloped adenoids, except Betty.
      The others all breathe through their noses. See how different their mouths
      are from Betty&rsquo;s lifting upper lip&mdash;very fascinating now, but
      later&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;ve gone so far as to prepare an object-lesson
      for you. Three extreme types of the mouth-breathers are here from school
      by my invitation to have some lemonade and cakes. They are outside now.
      When they come in, I want each of you to make an analysis of one of them,
      without their seeing it, of course. Talk with them about their work in
      school. You may get ideas from that. Mrs. Sharpless, you take the taller
      of the girls; Mrs. Clyde, you study the shorter. The boy goes to you, Mr.
      Clyde.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The trio of visitors entered, somewhat mystified, but delighted to be the
      guests of their friend, Dr. Strong, who had a faculty of interesting
      children. So shrewdly did he divert and hold their attention that they
      concluded their visit and left without having suspected the scrutiny which
      they had undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Clyde,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, after the good-byes were
      said, &ldquo;what about your girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in particular except that she&rsquo;s mortally homely and
      doesn&rsquo;t seem very bright.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Homely in what respect?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hatchet-faced, to use a slang term.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a slang term any more; it&rsquo;s a medical term to
      describe a typical result of mouth-breathing. The diversion of the breath
      destroys the even arch of the teeth, pushes the central teeth up, giving
      that squirrel-like expression that is so unpleasantly familiar, lengthens
      the mouth from the lower jaw&rsquo;s hanging down, and sharpens the whole
      profile to an edge, and an ugly one. Adenoids!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My tall girl I thought at first was dull, but I found the poor
      thing was a little deaf,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      got a horrid skin; so sallow and rough and pimply. I don&rsquo;t think her
      digestion is good. In fact, she said she had trouble with her stomach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. Her teeth are all out of place from facial malformation
      caused by mouth-breathing. That means that she can&rsquo;t properly chew
      her food. That means in turn that her digestion must suffer. That, again,
      means a bad complexion and a debilitated constitution. Adenoids! What&rsquo;s
      your analysis, Mr. Clyde?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy? He&rsquo;s two grades behind where he should be in
      school. It takes him some time to get the drift of anything that&rsquo;s
      said to him. I should judge his brain is weak. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t see
      where he keeps it, for the upper part of his face is all wrong, the roof
      of the mouth is so pushed up. The poor little chap&rsquo;s brain-pan must
      be contracted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly correct, and all the result of adenoids again. The boy is
      the worst example I&rsquo;ve been able to find. But all three of the
      children are terribly handicapped; one by a painful homeliness, one by a
      ruined digestion, and the boy by a mental deficiency&mdash;and all simply
      and solely because they were neglected by ignorant parents and still more
      ignorant school authorities.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have the public schools deal with such details?&rdquo;
      asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Have you ever heard what Goler, the Health Officer of
      Rochester, asked that city? &lsquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t we to close the schools
      and repair the children?&rsquo; he asked, and he kept on asking, until now
      Rochester has a regular system of looking after the noses, mouths, and
      eyes of its young. They want their children, in that city, to start the
      battle of life in fighting trim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t see many misshapen children about,&rdquo;
      objected Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t look. Call to your mind
      Hogarth&rsquo;s caricatures. Do you remember that in his crowds there are
      always clubfooted, or humpbacked, or deformed people? In those days such
      deformities were very common because medical science didn&rsquo;t know how
      to correct them in the young. To-day facial deformities, to the scientific
      eye, are quite as common, though not as obvious. We&rsquo;re just learning
      how to correct them, and to know that the hatchet-face is a far more
      serious clog on a human being&rsquo;s career than is the clubfoot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Betty had a clubfoot, of course&mdash;&rdquo; began Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;d have it repaired at whatever cost of
      suffering. You&rsquo;d submit her to a long and serious operation; and
      probably to the constant pain of a rigid iron frame upon her leg for
      months, perhaps years. To obviate the deformity you&rsquo;d consider that
      not too high a price to pay, and rightly. Well, here is the case of a more
      far-reaching malformation, curable by a minor operation, without danger,
      mercifully quick, with only the briefest after-effects of pain, and you
      draw back from it. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thought of the knife on that little face. Is&mdash;is that all
      there is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there are the teeth. They should be looked to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! They&rsquo;re only first teeth,&rdquo; said
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Sharpless vigorously. &ldquo;What does a doctor know about teeth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots, if he knows his business. There would be fewer dyspeptics if
      physicians in general sent their patients to the dentist more promptly,
      and kept them in condition to chew their food.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, when people have their real, lasting
      teeth,&rdquo; returned the grandmother. &ldquo;But Betty&rsquo;s first set
      will be gone in a few years. Then it will be time enough to bother the
      poor child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently, Mrs. Sharpless,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong mildly, &ldquo;you
      consider that teeth come in crops, like berries; one crop now, a second
      and distinct crop later. That isn&rsquo;t the way growth takes place in
      the human mouth. The first teeth are to the second almost what the blossom
      is to the fruit. I shall want immediately to take Betty to the dentist,
      and have him keep watch over her mouth with the understanding that he may
      charge a bonus on every tooth he keeps in after its time. The longer the
      first lot lasts, the better the second lot are. But there is no use making
      the minor repairs unless the main structure is put right first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see Betty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde abruptly, and left the
      room. Mrs. Sharpless followed. &ldquo;Now comes the first real split.&rdquo;
      Dr. Strong turned to Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to vote me
      down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it comes to a pinch,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde quietly, &ldquo;my
      wife will accept my decision.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I want to avoid. Where would my influence with her be,
      if I were obliged to appeal to you on the very first test of professional
      authority? No, I shall try to carry this through myself, even at the risk
      of having to seem a little brutal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde lifted his eyebrows, but he only nodded, as the door opened and
      the two women reentered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde, &ldquo;if, in a year from now,
      Betty hasn&rsquo;t outgrown the mouth-breathing, I&mdash;I&mdash;you may
      take what measures you think best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a year from now, the danger will be more advanced. There is not
      the faintest chance of correction of the fault without an operation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it! I can&rsquo;t stand the thought of it, now,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Clyde brokenly. &ldquo;You should see her, poor baby, as she
      looks now, asleep on the lounge in the library, and even you, Doctor&rdquo;
      (the doctor smiled a little awry at that), &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t bear to
      think of the blood and the pain.&rdquo; She was silent, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Clyde, the blood will be no more than a nosebleed, and
      the pain won&rsquo;t amount to much, thanks to anaesthesia. Let me see.&rdquo;
      He stepped to the door and, opening it softly, looked in, then beckoned to
      the others to join him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child lay asleep on her side, one cupped pink hand hanging, the other
      back of her head. Her jaw had dropped and the corner of the mouth had
      slackened down in an unnatural droop. The breath hissed a little between
      the soft lips. Dr. Strong closed the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, and there was a suggestion of the sternness
      of judgment in the monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am her mother.&rdquo; Mrs. Clyde faced him, a spot of color in
      each cheek. &ldquo;A mother is a better judge of her children than any
      doctor can be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; said Dr. Strong deliberately. &ldquo;Then I
      must set you right. Do you recall sending Charley away from the table for
      clumsiness, two days ago?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s expressive eyes widened.
      &ldquo;He overturned his glass, after my warning him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And once last week for the same thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, do you think your mother-judgment was wise then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really, Dr. Strong,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde, flushing, &ldquo;you
      will hardly assume the right of control of the children&rsquo;s manners&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a question of manners. There is where your error lies,&rdquo;
      interrupted the doctor. &ldquo;Against your mother-judgment I set my
      doctor-judgment, and I tell you now&rdquo;&mdash;his voice rose a little
      from its accustomed polished smoothness, and took on authority&mdash;&ldquo;I
      tell you that the boy is no more responsible for his clumsiness than Betty
      is for bad breathing. It&rsquo;s a disease, very faint but unmistakable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Charley!&rdquo; said his father incredulously, &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s
      as husky as a colt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be, please God, in a few years, but just now he has&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      be alarmed; it&rsquo;s nothing like so important as it sounds&mdash;he has
      a slight heart trouble, probably the sequel to that light and perhaps
      mismanaged diphtheria attack. It&rsquo;s quite a common result and is
      nearly always outgrown, and it shows in almost unnoticeable lack of
      control of hands and feet. I observed Charley&rsquo;s clumsiness long ago;
      listened at his heart, and heard the murmur there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never told us!&rdquo; reproached the grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the use? There&rsquo;s nothing to be done; nothing that
      needs to be done, except watch, and that I&rsquo;ve been doing. And I didn&rsquo;t
      want to worry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve been punishing him for what wasn&rsquo;t his fault,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Clyde in a choked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have. Don&rsquo;t punish Betty for what isn&rsquo;t hers,&rdquo;
      countered the physician, swiftly taking advantage of the opening. &ldquo;Give
      her her chance. Mrs. Clyde, if Betty were my own, she could hardly have
      wound herself more closely around my heartstrings. I want to see her grow
      from a strong and beautiful child to a strong and beautiful girl, and
      finally to a strong and beautiful woman. It rests with you. Watch her
      breathing to-night, as she sleeps&mdash;and tell me to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and left the room. Mr. Clyde walked over and put a hand softly on
      his wife&rsquo;s soft hair; then brushed her cheek with his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you, dearest,&rdquo; he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, Betty, overhanging the side fence, was heard, by her
      shamelessly eavesdropping father, imparting information to her next-door
      neighbor and friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d ought to get a new nothe, Thally. It don&rsquo;t hurt
      much, an&rsquo; breathin&rsquo; ith heapth more fun!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pondering a chain of suggestions induced by this advice, Mr. Clyde walked
      slowly to the house. As was his habit in thought, he proceeded to rub the
      idea into his chin, which was quite pink from friction by the time he
      reached the library. There he found Dr. Strong and Mrs. Sharpless in
      consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you two conspiring about?&rdquo; he asked, ceasing to rub
      the troubled spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter of school reports,&rdquo; answered the doctor. He glanced at
      the other&rsquo;s chin and smiled. &ldquo;And what is worrying you?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering whether I haven&rsquo;t made a mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite possibly. It&rsquo;s done by some of our best people,&rdquo;
      remarked the physician dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a pleasant possibility in this case. You remember quoting
      Rochester as to closing the schools and repairing the children. To-day, as
      I heard Betty commenting on her new nose, it suddenly came to me that I
      was obstructing that very system of repairs by which she is benefiting,
      for less fortunate youngsters in our schools.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Dr. Strong in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As president of the Public Health League. The Superintendent of
      Schools came to me with a complaint against Dr. Merritt, the Health
      Officer, who, he claimed, was usurping authority in his scheme for a
      special inspection system to examine all schoolchildren at regular
      intervals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought to have been established long ago,&rdquo; declared Dr.
      Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Superintendent thinks otherwise. He claims that it would
      interfere with school routine. It&rsquo;s the duty of the health
      officials, he says, to control epidemics from without, to keep sickness
      out of the schools, not to hunt around among the children, scaring them to
      death about diseases that probably aren&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong muttered something which Grandma Sharpless pretended not to
      hear. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve agreed to support him in that attitude?&rdquo;
      he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve half committed myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forgive you! Why, see here, Clyde, your dodo of a
      superintendent talks of keeping sickness out of the schools. Doesn&rsquo;t
      that mean keeping sickness out of the pupils? There&rsquo;s just one way
      to do that: get every child into the best possible condition of repair&mdash;eyes,
      ears, nose, throat, teeth, stomach, everything, and maintain them in that
      state. Then disease will have a hard time breaking down the natural
      resistance of the system. Damaged organs in a child are like flaws in a
      ship&rsquo;s armor-plate; a vital weakening of the defenses. And remember,
      the child is always battling against one besieging germ or another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t medical science wipe out the germs?&rdquo; demanded
      Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always claiming to do such wonders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few instances it can. In typhoid we fight and win the battle
      from the outside by doing that very thing. In smallpox, and to a lesser
      extent in diphtheria, we can build up an effective artificial barrier by
      inoculation. But, as medical men are now coming to realize, in the other
      important contagions of childhood, measles, whooping-cough, and scarlet
      fever, we must fight the disease from inside the individual; that is, make
      as nearly impregnable as possible the natural fortifications of the body
      to resist and repel the invasion. That is what school medical inspection
      aims at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t rank whooping-cough and measles with scarlet
      fever, would you?&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Although scarlet fever has the worst after-effects,&mdash;though
      not much more serious than those of measles,&mdash;the three are almost
      equal so far as the death-rate is concerned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not!&rdquo; protested the old lady. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d
      rather have measles in the house ten times, or whooping-cough either, than
      scarlet fever once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about ten times as likely to have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked puzzled. &ldquo;But what did you mean by saying that one of
      &lsquo;em is as bad as the other?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it&rsquo;s as dangerous to the community, though not to the
      individual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little deep for me, too,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it&rsquo;s perfectly simple. Here, take an example. Would you
      rather be bitten by a rattlesnake or a mosquito?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mosquito, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. Yet a rattlesnake country is a good deal safer than a
      mosquito country. You wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate, on account of your health,
      to move to Arizona, where rattlesnakes live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you <i>would</i> be afraid to establish your family in the
      malarious swamps of the South?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, people who die of malaria die of mosquito bite, since the
      mosquito is the only agency of infection. Thus, it reduces to this: that
      while the individual rattler is more dangerous than the individual
      mosquito, the mosquito, in general, kills her thousands where the snake
      kills one. Now&mdash;with considerable modification of the ratio&mdash;scarlet
      fever is the rattlesnake; whooping-cough and measles are the mosquitoes.
      It is just as important to keep measles out of a community as it is to
      shut out scarlet fever. In fact, if you will study the records of this
      city, you will find that in two out of the last three years, measles has
      killed more people than scarlet fever, and whooping-cough more than either
      of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do about it?&rdquo; asked the practical-minded
      Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if some one would only tell us that! In measles the worst of
      the harm is done before the disease announces itself definitely. The most
      contagious stage is previous to the appearance of the telltale rash. There&rsquo;s
      nothing but a snuffling nose, and perhaps a very little fever to give
      advance notice that the sufferer is a firebrand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t shut a child out of school for every little
      sore throat,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; replied the physician
      slowly and thoughtfully. &ldquo;A recent writer on school epidemics has
      suggested educating the public to believe that every sore throat is
      contagious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t true, is it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Personally I believe that, while a physician is often justified
      in deceiving his patient, he is never justified in fooling the public. In
      the long run they find him out and his influence for good is lessened. Yet
      that sore-throat theory is near enough true to be a strong temptation.
      Every sore throat is suspicious; that isn&rsquo;t too much to say. And,
      with a thorough school-inspection system, it is quite possible that
      epidemics could be headed off by isolating the early-discovered cases of
      sore throat. But, an epidemic of the common contagions, once well under
      way, seems to be quite beyond any certainty of control.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that quarantine and disinfection and isolation
      are all useless?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I won&rsquo;t go as far as that. They may exercise a check in
      some cases. But I will say this: that all our cumbersome and expensive and
      often harassing hygienic measures in the contagious diseases haven&rsquo;t
      made good. Obviously, if they had, we should see a diminution of the ills
      which they are supposed to limit. There is no diminution. No, we&rsquo;re
      on the wrong tack. Until we know what the right tack is, we perhaps ought
      to keep on doing what we can in the present line. It&rsquo;s a big,
      complicated subject, and one that won&rsquo;t be settled until we find out
      what scarlet fever, measles, and whooping-cough really are, and what
      causes them. While we&rsquo;re waiting for the bacteriologist to tell us
      that, the soundest principle of defense that we have is to keep the body
      up to its highest pitch of resistance. That is why I support medical
      inspection for schools as an essential measure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To repair the children without closing the schools, if I may modify
      Dr. Goler&rsquo;s epigram,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Eventually we shall have to build as well as repair. A
      very curious thing is happening to Young America in the Eastern States.
      The growing generation is shrinking in weight and height.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is almost contradictory enough for a paradox,&rdquo; remarked
      Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a melancholy and literal fact. You know, there&rsquo;s a
      height and weight basis for age upon which our school grading system
      rests. The authorities have been obliged to reconstruct it because the
      children are continuously growing smaller for their years. <i>There&rsquo;s</i>
      work for the inspection force!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d put the children on pulleys and stretch &lsquo;em out,
      I suppose!&rdquo; gibed Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might work, too,&rdquo; replied the doctor, unruffled. &ldquo;The
      Procrustean system isn&rsquo;t so bad, if old Procrustes had only sent his
      victims to the gymnasium instead of putting them to bed. Yes, a quarter of
      an hour with the weight-pulleys every day would help undersized kiddies a
      good deal. But principally I should want the school-inspectors to keep the
      youngsters playing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to teach a child to play,&rdquo; sniffed
      Grandma Sharpless, with womanly scorn of mere man&rsquo;s views concerning
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mrs. Sharpless, you taught your children to play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! Whatever makes you think that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The simple fact that they didn&rsquo;t die in babyhood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sharpless looked at him with a severity not unmingled with suspicion.
      &ldquo;Sometimes, young man,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;you talk like a&mdash;a&mdash;a
      gump!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that, Strong!&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, joining in the doctor&rsquo;s
      laugh against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Facts may sometimes sound foolish,&rdquo; admitted Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;If they do, that&rsquo;s the fault of the speaker. And it <i>is</i>
      a fact that every mother teaches her baby to play. Watch the cat if you
      don&rsquo;t believe me. The wisest woman in America points out in her
      recent book that it is the mother&rsquo;s playing with her baby which
      rouses in it the will to live. Without that will to live none of us would
      survive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who your wisest woman in America may be, but I
      don&rsquo;t believe she knows what she is talking about,&rdquo; declared
      Grandma Sharpless flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known her when she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted
      the doctor. &ldquo;If Jane Addams of Hull House isn&rsquo;t an expert in
      life, mental, moral, and physical, then there&rsquo;s no such person! Why,
      see here, Mrs. Sharpless; do you know why a baby&rsquo;s chance of
      survival is less in the very best possible institution without its mother,
      than in the very worst imaginable tenement with its mother, even though
      the mother is unable to nurse it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as well tended, I expect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All its physical surroundings are a thousand times more
      advantageous: better air, better food, better temperature, better
      safeguarding against disease; yet babies in these surroundings just pine
      away and die. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to bring up an infant on an
      institutional system. The infant death-rate of these well-meaning places
      is so appalling that nobody dares tell it publicly. And it is so, simply
      because there is no one to play with the babies. The nurses haven&rsquo;t
      the time, though they have the instinct. I tell you, the most wonderful,
      mystic, profound thing in all the world, to me, is the sight of a young
      girl&rsquo;s intuitive yearning to dandle every baby she may see. That&rsquo;s
      the universal world-old, world-wide, deep-rooted genius of motherhood,
      which antedates the humankind, stirring within her and impelling her to
      help keep the race alive&mdash;by playing with the baby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it in that way,&rdquo;
      confessed Grandma Sharpless. &ldquo;There may be something in what you
      say, young man. But by the time children reach school age I guess they&rsquo;ve
      learned that lesson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always. At least, not properly, always. Let&rsquo;s consult the
      Committee on School of our household organization.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent for eight-year-old Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Question to lay before you, Miss Chairwoman,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Strong. &ldquo;How many of the girls in your grade hang around the hall or
      doorways during recess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lots!&rdquo; said Julia promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they the bigger girls? or the smaller ones?&rdquo; The
      Committee on School considered the matter gravely. &ldquo;Mary Hinks, she&rsquo;s
      tall, but she&rsquo;s awful thin and sickly,&rdquo; she pronounced.
      &ldquo;Dot Griswold and Cora Smith and Tiny Warley&mdash;why, I guess they&rsquo;re
      most all the littlest girls in the class.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong nodded. &ldquo;Sure to be the undernourished, anaemic,
      lethargic ones,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re forgetting the
      lessons of their babyhood. Insensibly they are losing the will to live.
      But there&rsquo;s nobody to tell them so. A thorough medical inspection
      service would correct that. It would include school-nurses who would go to
      the homes of the children and tell the parents what was the matter. Such a
      system might not be warranted to keep epidemics out of our schools, but it
      would stretch out and fill out those meager youngsters&rsquo; brains as
      well as bodies, and fit them to combat illness if it did come. The whole
      theory of the school&rsquo;s attitude toward the child seems to me
      misconceived by those who have charge of the system. It assumes too much
      in authority and avoids too much in responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the case of John Smith, who has two children to bring up under
      our enlightened system of government. Government says to John Smith,
      &lsquo;Send your children to school!&rsquo; &lsquo;Suppose I don&rsquo;t
      wish to?&rsquo; says John Smith. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to,&rsquo; says
      Government. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t safe for me to have them left
      uneducated.&rsquo; &lsquo;Will you take care of them while they&rsquo;re
      at school?&rsquo; says John Smith. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll train their minds,&rsquo;
      says Government. &lsquo;What about their bodies?&rsquo; says John Smith.
      &lsquo;Hm!&rsquo; says Government; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a horse of another
      color.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come with them and see that they&rsquo;re
      looked after physically,&rsquo; says John Smith. &lsquo;You <i>will</i>
      not!&rsquo; says Government. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m <i>in loco &lsquo;parentis</i>,
      while they&rsquo;re in school.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then you take the entire <i>loco</i>
      of the <i>parentis</i>,&rsquo; says John Smith. &lsquo;If you take my
      children away on the ground that you&rsquo;re better fitted to care for
      their minds than I am, you ought to be at least as ready to look after
      their health. Otherwise,&rsquo; says John Smith, &lsquo;go and teach
      yourself to stand on your head. You can&rsquo;t teach <i>my</i> children.&rsquo;
      Now,&rdquo; concluded Dr. Strong, &ldquo;do you see any flaws in the Smith
      point of view?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just plain common sense,&rdquo; approved Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clyde,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, with a twinkle, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t
      stop rubbing a hole in your chin, I&rsquo;ll have to repair <i>you</i>.
      What&rsquo;s preying on your mind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying,&rdquo; replied Mr. Clyde deliberately, &ldquo;to
      figure out, with reference to the School Superintendent and myself, just
      how a man who has made a fool of himself can write a letter to another man
      who has helped the first man make a fool of himself, admitting that he&rsquo;s
      made a fool of himself, and yet avoid embarrassment, either to the man who
      has made a fool of himself or to the other man who aided the man in making
      a fool of himself. Do you get that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Chinese doctor,&rdquo; he observed,
      &ldquo;not a Chinese puzzle-solver. That&rsquo;s a matter between you and
      your ink-well. Meantime, having attained the point for which I&rsquo;ve
      been climbing, I now declare this session adjourned.&rdquo;

      IV.&mdash;THE CORNER DRUG-STORE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;N</span>o, it won&rsquo;t
      add to the attractiveness of the neighborhood, perhaps,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Clyde thoughtfully. &ldquo;But how convenient it will be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde had come home with the news that a drug-store was to be opened
      shortly on the adjacent corner. Shifting his position to dodge a
      foliage-piercing shaft of sunlight&mdash;they were all sitting out on the
      shady lawn, in the cool of a September afternoon&mdash;Dr. Strong shook
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too convenient, altogether,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; queried Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;A drugstore is
      like a gun in Texas: you may not need it often, but when you do need it,
      you need it like blazes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. But most people over-patronize the drug-store.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this family; at least, since our house-doctor came to keep us
      well on the Chinese plan,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dr. Strong only looked rueful. &ldquo;Your Chinese doctor has to plead
      guilty to negligence of what has been going on under his very nose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not more trouble!&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Clyde. She had come
      through the dreaded ordeal of little Betty&rsquo;s operation for adenoids&mdash;which
      had proved to be, after all, so slight and comparatively painless&mdash;with
      a greatly augmented respect for and trust in Dr. Strong; but her nerves
      still quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to trouble you,&rdquo; the doctor assured her, &ldquo;but
      enough to make me feel guilty&mdash;and stupid. Have you noticed any
      change in Manny, lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manny&rdquo; was fourteen-year-old Maynard Clyde, the oldest of the
      children; a high school lad, tall, lathy, athletic, and good-tempered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy is as nervous as a witch,&rdquo; put in Grandma Sharpless.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed it since early summer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wish you had taught me my trade,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;Manny is so husky and active that I&rsquo;ve hardly given him a
      thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo; asked the father
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much drug-store,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;Not drugs!&rdquo;
      cried Mrs. Clyde, horrified. &ldquo;That child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no; not in the sense you mean it. Wait; there he is now.
      Manny!&rdquo; he called, raising his voice. &ldquo;Come over here a
      minute, will you?&rdquo; The boy ambled over, and dropped down on the
      grass. He was brown, thin, and hard-trained; but there was a nervous
      pucker between his eyes, which his father noted for the first time.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? A meeting of the Board? Anything for the
      Committee on Milk Supply to do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present,&rdquo; answered Dr. Strong, &ldquo;except to answer
      a question or two. You don&rsquo;t drink coffee, do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;m trying for shortstop on the junior nine,
      you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you making out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten!&rdquo; said the boy despondently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem
      to have any grip on myself this year. Sort o&rsquo; get the rattles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m-m. Feel pretty thirsty after the practice, and usually stop in
      at the soda-fountain for some of those patent soft drinks advertised to be
      harmless but stimulating, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the doctor carelessly; &ldquo;three or four glasses
      a day, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Manny thought a moment. &ldquo;All of that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you quit it,&rdquo; advised the doctor, &ldquo;if you want to
      make the ball team. It will put you off your game worse than tea or
      coffee. Tell the athletic instructor I said so, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was any
      harm in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Manny walked away, Dr. Strong turned to
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;I found out about Manny by accident. No wonder the boy
      is nervous. He&rsquo;s been drinking that stuff like water, with no
      thought of what&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> in it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caffeine, generally. The most widely used of the lot is a mixture
      of fruit syrups doctored up with that drug. There&rsquo;s as much
      nerve-excitation in a glass of it&mdash;yes, and more&mdash;than in a cup
      of strong coffee. What would you think of a fourteen-year-old boy who
      drank five cups of strong coffee every day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think his parents were fools,&rdquo; declared Grandma
      Sharpless bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or his physician,&rdquo; suggested Dr. Strong. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      seen cases of people drinking twenty to twenty-five glasses of that
      &lsquo;harmless&rsquo; stuff every day. Of course, they were on the road
      to nervous smash-up. But the craving for it was established and they hadn&rsquo;t
      the nerve to stop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soda-fountain as a public peril,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more in that than can be smiled away,&rdquo; retorted
      the doctor vigorously. &ldquo;What between nerve-foods that are simply
      disguised &lsquo;bracers,&rsquo; and dangerous, heart-depressing dopes, like
      bromo-seltzer, the soda-fountain does its share of damage in the
      community.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about soda-water; that is innocent, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If the syrups are pure, soda-water is a good thing in
      moderation. So are the mineral waters. But there is this to be said about
      soda-water and candy, particularly the latter&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said,&rdquo; broke in Grandma Sharpless, &ldquo;that
      candy-eating would ruin any digestion.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve
      always been wrong, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Candy, well
      and honestly made, is excellent food at the proper time. The trouble is,
      both with candy and with the heavy, rich soda-waters, that people are
      continually filling up with them between meals. Now the stomach is a
      machine with a great amount of work to do, and is entitled to some
      consideration. Clyde, what would happen to the machines in your factory,
      if you didn&rsquo;t give them proper intervals of rest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be very short-lived,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a curious thing about machinery which everybody knows but nobody
      understands: running a machine twenty-four hours a day for one week gives
      it harder wear than running it twelve hours a day for a month. It needs a
      regular rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So with the machinery of digestion,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;The
      stomach and intestines have their hard work after meals. How are they to
      rest up, if an odd lot of candy or a slab of rich ice-cream soda come
      sliding down between whiles to be attended to? Eat your candy at the end
      of a meal, if you want it. It&rsquo;s a good desert. But whatever you eat,
      give your digestion a fair chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can digest anything if you use Thingumbob Pills,&rdquo;
      observed Mr. Clyde sardonically. &ldquo;The newspapers say so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of doctrine that makes dyspeptics,&rdquo;
      returned Dr. Strong. &ldquo;The American stomach is the worst-abused organ
      in creation. Saliva is the true digestive. If people would take time to
      chew properly, half the dyspepsia-pill fakers would go out of business. If
      they&rsquo;d take time to exercise properly, the other half would
      disappear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liver pills were my regular dependence a few years ago,&rdquo;
      remarked Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Since I took up hand-ball I haven&rsquo;t
      needed them. But I suppose that half the business men in town think they
      couldn&rsquo;t live without drugging themselves two or three times a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. Tell the average American any sort of a lie in print,
      about his digestion, and he&rsquo;ll swallow it whole, together with the
      drug which the lie is intended to sell. Look at the Cascaret advertising.
      Its tendency is to induce, not an occasional recourse to Cascarets, but a
      steady use of them. Any man foolish enough to follow the advice of the
      advertisements would form a Cascaret habit and bring his digestion into a
      state of slavery. That sort of appeal has probably ruined more digestions
      and spoiled more tempers than any devil-dogma ever put into type.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Castor-oil is good enough for me,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough for anybody&mdash;that is to say, bad enough
      and nasty enough so that there isn&rsquo;t much danger of its being
      abused. But these infernal sugar-coated candy cathartics get a hold on a
      man&rsquo;s intestinal organization so that it can&rsquo;t do its work
      without &lsquo;em, and, Lord knows, it can&rsquo;t stand their stimulus
      indefinitely. Then along comes appendicitis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But some of the laxative medicines advertise to prevent
      appendicitis,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong&rsquo;s face was very grim. &ldquo;Yes, they advertise.
      Commercial travelers, because of their irregular habits, are great
      pill-guzzlers as a class. Appendicitis is a very common complaint among
      them. A Pittsburgh surgeon with a large practice among traveling men has
      kept records, and he believes that more than fifty per cent of the
      appendicitis cases he treats are caused by the &lsquo;liver-pill&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;steady-cathartic&rsquo; habit. He explains his theory in this way.
      The man begins taking the laxative to correct his bad habits of life.
      Little by little he increases his dose, as the digestive mechanism grows
      less responsive to the stimulus, until presently an overdose sets his
      intestines churning around with a violence never intended by nature. Then,
      under this abnormal peristalsis, as it is called, the appendix becomes
      infected, and there&rsquo;s nothing for it but the surgeon&rsquo;s knife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have people run to the doctor and pay two dollars every
      time their stomach got a little out of kilter?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Sharpless
      shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run to the doctor; run to the minister; run to the plumber; run
      anywhere so long as you run far enough and fast enough,&rdquo; answered
      Dr. Strong with a smile. &ldquo;A mile a day at a good clip, or three
      miles of brisk walking would be the beginning of a readjustment. Less food
      more slowly eaten and no strong liquors would complete the cure in nine
      cases out of ten. The tenth case needs the doctor; not the
      newspaper-and-drug-store pill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all patent medicines aren&rsquo;t bad, are they?&rdquo; asked
      Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Some have very good testimonials.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bought or wheedled. Any medicine which claims to <i>cure</i> is a
      fraud and a swindle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me, young man!&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless.
      &ldquo;You doctors are prejudiced against patent medicines, but we old
      folks have used &lsquo;em long enough to know which are good and which are
      bad. Now I don&rsquo;t claim but what the Indian herb remedies and the
      &lsquo;ready reliefs&rsquo; and that lot are frauds. But my family was
      brought up on teething powders and soothing syrups.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re fortunate,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong sternly,
      &ldquo;that none of them has turned out to be an opium fiend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant he said it, he saw, with sharp regret, that his shaft had sped
      true to the mark. The clear, dark red of a hale old age faded from Grandma
      Sharpless&rsquo;s cheeks. Mr. Clyde shot a quick glance of warning at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And speaking of Indian remedies,&rdquo; went on the doctor glibly,
      &ldquo;I remember as a boy&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless steadily. &ldquo;The
      truth isn&rsquo;t going to hurt me. Or, if it does hurt, maybe it&rsquo;s
      right it should. I had a younger brother who died in a sanitarium for
      drug-habit when he was twenty-four. As a child he pretty nearly lived on
      soothing syrups; had to have them all the time, because he was such a
      nervous little fellow; always having earache and stomach-ache, until he
      was eight or nine years old. Then he got better and became a strong,
      active boy, and a robust man. After his college course he went to
      Philadelphia, and was doing well when he contracted the morphine habit&mdash;how
      or why, we never knew. It killed him in three years. Do you think&mdash;is
      it possible that the soothing syrups&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard they have
      morphine in them&mdash;had anything to do with his ruin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Sharpless,&rdquo; said the other, very gently, &ldquo;I
      can only put it before you in this way. Here is one of the most subtle and
      enslaving of all drugs, morphine. It is fed to a child, in the plastic and
      formative years of life, regularly. What surer way could there be of
      planting the seeds of drug-habit? Suppose, for illustration, we substitute
      alcohol, which is far less dangerous. If you gave a child, from the time
      of his second year to his eighth, let us say, two or three drinks of
      whiskey every day, and that child, when grown up, developed into a
      drunkard, would you think it strange?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think it strange if he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apply the same logic to opium, or its derivative, morphine. There
      are a dozen preparations regularly used for children, containing opium, or
      morphine, such as Mrs. Winslow&rsquo;s &lsquo;Soothing Syrup,&rsquo; and
      Kopp&rsquo;s &lsquo;Baby Friend.&rsquo; This is well known, and it is also
      a recognized fact that the morphine and opium habit is steadily increasing
      in this country. Isn&rsquo;t it reasonable to infer a connection between
      the two? Further, some of the highest authorities believe that the use of
      these drugs in childhood predisposes to the drink habit also, later in
      life. The nerves are unsettled; they are habituated to a morbid craving,
      and, at a later period, that craving is liable to return in a changed
      manifestation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a drug-store can&rsquo;t sell opium or morphine except on
      prescription, can it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can <i>in a patent medicine</i>,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the ugly phases of the drug business. Yet it&rsquo;s
      possible to find honest people who believe in these dopes and even give
      testimonials to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some testimonials are hard to believe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde,
      thankfully accepting the chance to shift the conversation to a less
      painful phase of the topic. &ldquo;Old Mrs. Dibble in our church is
      convinced that she owes her health to Hall&rsquo;s Catarrh Cure.&rdquo;
      Dr. Strong smiled sardonically. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the nostrum which
      offers one hundred dollars reward for any case it can&rsquo;t cure; and
      when a disgusted dupe tried to get the one hundred dollars, they said he
      hadn&rsquo;t given their remedy a sufficient trial: he&rsquo;d taken only
      twenty-odd bottles. So your friend thinks that a useless mixture of
      alcohol and iodide of potassium fixed her, does she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she? She had a case of catarrh. She took three
      bottles of the medicine, and her catarrh is all gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s extend her line of reasoning to some other
      cases. While old Mr. Barker, around on Halsey Street, was very ill with
      pneumonia last month, he fell out of bed and broke his arm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two places,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;I saw him walking
      up the street yesterday, all trussed up like a chicken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite recovered from pneumonia, however. Then there was little Mrs.
      Bowles: she had typhoid, you remember, and at the height of the fever a
      strange cat got into the room and frightened her into hysterics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she got well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re up
      in the woods now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Moral (according to Mrs. Dibble&rsquo;s experience with
      Hall&rsquo;s Catarrh Cure): for pneumonia, try a broken arm; in case of
      typhoid, set a cat on the patient.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde laughed. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People get well in
      spite of these patent medicines, rather than by virtue of them. <i>Post
      hoc, non propter hoc</i>, as our lawyer friends say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it. The human body keeps up a sort of drug-store
      of its own. As soon as disease fastens on it, it goes to work in a subtle
      and mysterious way, manufacturing a cure for that disease. If it&rsquo;s
      diphtheria, the body produces antitoxin, and we give it more to help it
      on. If it&rsquo;s jaundice, it produces a special quality of gastric
      juices to correct the evil conditions. In the vast majority of attacks,
      the body drives out the disease by its own efforts; yet, if the patient
      chances to have been idiot enough to take some quack &lsquo;cure&rsquo;
      the credit goes to that medicine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to the doctor, if it&rsquo;s a doctor&rsquo;s case,&rdquo;
      suggested Grandma Sharpless, with a twinkle of malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me a doctor who boasts &lsquo;I can cure you,&rsquo; whether
      by word of mouth or in print, and I&rsquo;ll show you a quack,&rdquo;
      returned the other warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is a doctor for in a sick-room, if not to cure?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a captain for on a ship?&rdquo; countered Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t cure a storm, can he? But he can guide the vessel so
      that she can weather it. Well, our medical captains lose a good many
      commands; the storm is often too severe for human skill. But they save a
      good many, too, by skillful handling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is no such thing as an actual cure, in medicine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. In a sense there are several. Antitoxin may be called a
      cure for diphtheria. Quinine is, to some extent, a specific in malaria.
      And Ehrlich&rsquo;s famous &lsquo;606&rsquo; has been remarkably, though
      not unfailingly, successful in that terrible blood-plague, born of
      debauchery, which strikes the innocent through the guilty. All these
      remedies, however, come, not through the quack and the drug-store, but
      through the physician and the laboratory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May not the patent medicines, also, help to guide the physical ship
      through the storm?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde, adopting the doctor&rsquo;s
      simile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On to the rocks,&rdquo; he replied quickly. &ldquo;Look at the
      consumption cures. To many consumptives, alcohol is deadly. Yet a wretched
      concoction like Duffy&rsquo;s Malt Whiskey, advertised to cure
      tuberculosis, flaunts its lies everywhere. And the law is powerless to
      check the suicidal course of the poor fools who believe and take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought the Pure Food Law stopped all that,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Clyde innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pure Food Law! The life has been almost crushed out of it.
      Roosevelt whacked it over the head with his Referee Board, which granted
      immunity to the food poisoners, and afterward the Supreme Court and
      Wickersham treated it to a course of &lsquo;legal interpretations,&rsquo;
      which generally signify a way to get around a good law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the patent medicines aren&rsquo;t allowed to make false claims
      any more, as I understand it,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That applies only to the label on the bottle. So you&rsquo;ll find
      that the words &lsquo;alcohol,&rsquo; &lsquo;opium,&rsquo; &lsquo;acetanilid,&rsquo;
      &lsquo;chloral,&rsquo; and other terms of poison, have sprouted forth
      there, in very small and inconspicuous type. But there&rsquo;s a free
      field for the false promises on sign-boards, in the street-cars, in the
      newspapers, everywhere. Look in the next drug-store window you pass and
      you&rsquo;ll see &lsquo;sure cures&rsquo; exploited in terms that would
      make Ananias feel like an amateur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make out a pretty poor character for the druggists, as a class,&rdquo;
      observed Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. As a class, they&rsquo;re a decent, self-respecting,
      honorable lot of men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do they stick to a bad trade?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong got to his feet. &ldquo;Let one of them answer,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Mr. Gormley, who runs the big store in the Arcade, usually passes
      here about this time, and I think I see him coming now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can talk all they like,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless
      emphatically, as the doctor walked across to the front fence, &ldquo;but I
      wouldn&rsquo;t be without a bottle of cough syrup in the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I without my headache tablets,&rdquo; added Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      have had to give up the bridge party yesterday but for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde shot a sharp glance, first, at his wife, then at her mother.
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to see the labels on your particular brands of
      medicine,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing bad in mine,&rdquo; asserted Mrs. Clyde.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Martin recommended them to me; she&rsquo;s been taking them
      for years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Dr. Strong returned, bringing with him a slim, elderly man,
      whose shrewd, wide eyes peered through a pair of gold-rimmed glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you want me to give away the secrets of my trade,&rdquo; he
      remarked good-humoredly, after the greetings. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t
      object to relieving my mind, once in a while. So shoot, and if I can&rsquo;t
      dodge, I&rsquo;ll yell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you deal in patent medicines if they&rsquo;re so bad?&rdquo;
      asked Grandma Sharpless bluntly. &ldquo;Is there such a big profit in
      them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No profit, worth speaking of,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gormley. &ldquo;Though
      you&rsquo;ll note that I haven&rsquo;t admitted they are bad&mdash;as yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bulk of your trade is in that class of goods, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      queried Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse luck, it is. They&rsquo;ve got us through their hold on the
      public. And they not only force us to be their agents, but they grind us
      down to the very smallest profit; sometimes less than the cost of doing
      business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t compelled to deal in their medicines,&rdquo;
      objected Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically I am. My really profitable trade is in filling
      prescriptions. There I can legitimately charge, not only for the drugs,
      but also for my special technical skill and knowledge. But in order to
      maintain my prescription trade I must keep people coming to my store. And
      they won&rsquo;t come unless I carry what they demand in the way of patent
      medicines.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is a legitimate demand for patent medicines?&rdquo; said
      Mr. Clyde quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legitimate? Hardly. It&rsquo;s purely an inspired demand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes it persist, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspapers. The patent-medicine advertisers fill the daily
      columns with their claims, and create a demand by the force of repeated
      falsehood. Do you know the universal formula for the cost of patent cures?
      Here it is: Drugs, 3 per cent; manufacturing plant, 7 per cent; printing
      ink, 90 per cent. It&rsquo;s a sickening business. If I could afford it, I&rsquo;d
      break loose like that fellow McConnell in Chicago and put a placard of
      warning in my show window. Here&rsquo;s a copy of the one he displays in
      his drug-store.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a card from his pocket, Mr. Gormley held it up for the circle to
      read. The inscription was:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Please do not ask us what </i>any old patent, medicine<i> is
      worth, for you embarrass us, as our honest answer must be that </i>it is
      worthless<i>. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean to ask us at what price we sell it, that is an entirely
      different proposition. When sick, consult a good physician. It is the only
      proper course. And you will find it cheaper in the end than
      self-medication with worthless<i> &lsquo;patent&rsquo; nostrums.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has that killed his trade in quackery?&rdquo; asked Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can kill that. It has cut it down by half, though. It&rsquo;s
      a peculiar and disheartening fact that the public will believe the paid
      lie of a newspaper advertisement and disregard the plain truth from an
      expert. And see here, Dr. Strong, when you doctors get together and roast
      the pharmaceutical trade, just remember that it&rsquo;s really the
      newspapers and not the drug-stores that sell patent medicines.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are all of them so bad?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that claim to <i>cure</i>. They&rsquo;re either frauds,
      appealing to the appetite by a stiff allowance of booze, like Swamp Root
      and Peruna, or disguised dopes,&mdash;opium, hasheesh or chloral,&mdash;masquerading
      as soothing syrups, cough medicines, and consumption cures; or artificial
      devices for giving yourself heart disease by the use of coal-tar chemicals
      in the headache powders and anti-pain pills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t make me believe, Mr. Drug-man,&rdquo; said
      Grandma Sharpless with a belligerent shake of her head, &ldquo;that a
      patent medicine which keeps on being in demand for years, on its own
      merits, hasn&rsquo;t something good in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed the visitor. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t want to. There isn&rsquo;t any such patent medicine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s hundreds of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; contradicted the old
      lady, with the exaggeration of the disputant who finds the ground dropping
      away from underfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that sell on their own merits. Advertising and more advertising
      and still more advertising is all that does it. Let any one of them drop
      out of the newspapers and off the bill-boards, and the demand for it would
      be dead in a year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, as a student of business conditions,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to side with Mrs. Sharpless and believe that any
      line of goods which has come down from yesterday to to-day must have some
      merit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The druggist took off his glasses, wiped them and waved them in the air,
      with a flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The way to dusty death,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      he quoted sonorously. &ldquo;We think ourselves heirs to the wisdom of the
      ages, without stopping to consider that we&rsquo;re heirs to the
      foolishness, also. We&rsquo;re gulled by the printed lie about Doan&rsquo;s
      Kidney Pills, just as our fathers were by the cart-tail oratory of the
      itinerant quack who sold the &lsquo;Wonderful Indian Secrets of Life&rsquo;
      at one dollar per bottle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hesitate to admit it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde, with a little
      laugh, &ldquo;but we always have a few of the old remedies about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you name some of them over,&rdquo; suggested the druggist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usually I keep some One-Night Cough Cure in the house. That&rsquo;s
      harmless, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The druggist glanced at Dr. Strong, and they both grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>might</i> be harmless,&rdquo; said the druggist mildly,
      &ldquo;if it didn&rsquo;t contain both morphine and hasheesh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde, horrified. &ldquo;How could one
      suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By reading the label carefully,&rdquo; interjected Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think. I&rsquo;ve always considered Jayne&rsquo;s
      Expectorant good for the children when they have a cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tastes differ,&rdquo; observed the druggist philosophically.
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t consider opium good for <i>my</i> children inside
      or outside of any expectorant. Next!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the names <i>sound</i> so innocent!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Clyde.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost afraid to tell any more. But we always have Rexall
      Cholera Cure on hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had much cholera in the house lately?&rdquo; inquired the druggist,
      with an affectation of extreme interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s only for stomach-ache,&rdquo; explained Mrs.
      Clyde. &ldquo;It certainly does cure the pain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not cure,&mdash;drug it into unconsciousness,&rdquo; amended Mr.
      Gormley. &ldquo;The opium in it does that. Rather a heroic remedy, opium,
      for a little stomach-ache, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got to say against Kohler&rsquo;s One-Night Cough
      Cure that I always keep by me?&rdquo; demanded Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gormley beamed on her in deprecatory good nature. &ldquo;Who? Me?
      Gracious! I&rsquo;ve got nothing to say against it worse than it says
      against itself, on its label. Morphine, chloroform, and hasheesh. What
      more <i>is</i> there to say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has this house been full of assorted poisons?&rdquo; asked
      Mr. Clyde suddenly of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Tom,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been
      careful about using them for the children. Personally, I never touch
      patent medicines.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this her mother, smarting under their caller&rsquo;s criticism of
      her cough syrup, turned on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call those headache tablets you take?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those? They aren&rsquo;t a patent medicine. They&rsquo;re
      Anti-kamnia, a physician&rsquo;s prescription.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a fine prescription they are!&rdquo; said the druggist.
      &ldquo;Did you ever read the Anti-kamnia booklet? For whole-souled,
      able-bodied, fore-and-aft, up-and-down stairs professional lying, it has
      got most of the patent medicines relegated to the infant class. Harmless,
      they say! I&rsquo;ve seen a woman take two of those things and hardly get
      out of the door before they got in their fine work on her heart and over
      she went like a shot rabbit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it was touch and go with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in that; opium, too?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a coal-tar chemical which puts a clamp on the heart action. One
      or another of the coal-tar drugs is in all the headache powders. There&rsquo;s
      a long list of deaths from them, not to mention cases of drug-habit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Habit?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Do you mean I&rsquo;m in
      danger of not being able to get along without the tablets?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you take them steadily you certainly are. If you take them
      occasionally, you&rsquo;re only in danger of dropping dead one of these
      days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s chin abruptly assumed a prominence which he seldom
      permitted it. &ldquo;Well, that settles <i>that</i>,&rdquo; he observed;
      and it was entirely unnecessary for any one present to ask any
      amplification of the remark. Mrs. Clyde looked at her mother for sympathy&mdash;and
      didn&rsquo;t get any.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever I see a woman come into the shop,&rdquo; continued the
      druggist, &ldquo;with a whitey-blue complexion and little gray&rsquo;
      flabby wrinkles under her eyes, I know without asking what <i>she</i>
      wants. She&rsquo;s a headache-powder fiend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That queer look they have is from deterioration of the blood,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;The acetanilid or acetphenetidin or whatever the
      coal-tar derivative may be, seems to kill the red corpuscles. In extreme
      cases of this I&rsquo;ve seen blood the color of muddy water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly makes a fright of a woman. &lsquo;Orangeine&rsquo;
      gets a lot of &lsquo;em. You&rsquo; ve seen its advertisements in the
      street-cars. The owner of Orangeine, a Chicago man, got the habit himself:
      used fairly to live on the stuff, until pop! went his heart. He&rsquo;s a
      living, or, rather a dead illustration of what his own dope will do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you to do for a splitting headache?&rdquo; queried
      Mrs. Clyde, turning to Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, unless I know what causes it,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Strong. &ldquo;Headache isn&rsquo;t a disease. It&rsquo;s a symptom, a
      danger signal. It&rsquo;s the body&rsquo;s way of crying for help. Drugs
      don&rsquo;t cure a headache. They simply interrupt it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What with the headache-powders breeding the drug habit, and the
      consumption cures and cough medicines making dope fiends, and the malt
      whiskey cures and Perunas furnishing quiet joy to the temperance trade, I
      sometimes wonder what we&rsquo;re coming to,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gormley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde rubbed his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;But poor people who can&rsquo;t
      afford a doctor have no recourse but to patent medicines,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford a doctor!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Why,
      don&rsquo;t you know that nostrum-taking is the most expensive form of
      treatment? Did you ever happen to see A. B. Frost&rsquo;s powerful cartoon
      called &lsquo;Her Last Dollar&rsquo;? A woman, thin, bent, and ravaged
      with disease, is buying, across the counter of a country store, a bottle
      of some kind of &lsquo;sure cure,&rsquo; from the merchant, who serves her
      with a smile, half-pitying, half-cynical, while her two ragged children,
      with hunger and hope in their pinched faces, gaze wistfully at the food in
      the glass cases. There&rsquo;s the whole tragedy of a wasted life in that
      picture. &lsquo;Her Last Dollar!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what the patent
      medicine is after. A doctor at least <i>tries</i> to cure. But the patent
      medicine shark&rsquo;s policy is to keep the sufferer buying as long as
      there is a dollar left to buy with. Why, a nostrum that advertises heavily
      has got to sell six bottles or seven to each victim before the cost of
      catching that victim is defrayed. After that, the profits. Since you&rsquo;ve
      brought up the matter of expense, I&rsquo;ll give you an instance from
      your own household, Clyde.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried Mr. Clyde, sitting up
      straight. &ldquo;More patent dosing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the servants,&mdash;Maggie, the nurse. I&rsquo;ve got her
      whole medical history and she&rsquo;s a prime example of the Dupe&rsquo;s
      Progress. She&rsquo;s run the gamut of fake cures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something must have been the matter with her to start her off,
      though,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the joke&mdash;or would be if it weren&rsquo;t
      pathetic. She started out by having headaches. Not knowing any better, she
      took headache-powders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One for you, Myra,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Clyde to his wife, in an
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad heart action and difficulty in breathing&mdash;the natural
      result&mdash;scared her into the belief that she had heart trouble.
      Impetus was given to this notion by an advertisement which she found in a
      weekly, a religious weekly (God save the mark!), advising her not to drop
      dead of heart disease. To avoid this awful fate, which was illustrated by
      a sprightly sketch of a man falling flat on the sidewalk, she was
      earnestly implored to try Kinsman&rsquo;s heart remedy. She did so, and,
      of course, got worse, since the &lsquo;remedy&rsquo; was merely a swindle.
      About this time Maggie&rsquo;s stomach began to &lsquo;act up,&rsquo;
      partly from the medicines, partly from the original trouble which caused
      her headaches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us what that was, Strong,&rdquo; remarked
      Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later. Maggie now developed catarrh of the stomach, superinduced by
      reading one of old Dr. Hartman&rsquo;s Peruna ads. She took seven bottles
      of Peruna, and it cheered her up quite a bit&mdash;temporarily and
      alcoholically.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was <i>that</i> that I smelled on her breath. And I accused
      her of drinking,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde remorsefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she had been; raw alcohol, flavored with a little caramel and
      doctored up with a few drugs. Toward the close of her Peruna career, her
      stomach became pretty sensitive. Also, as she wasn&rsquo;t accustomed to
      strong liquor, her kidneys were affected somewhat. In her daily paper she
      read a clarion call from Dr. Kilmer of the Swamp Root swindle (the real
      Dr. Kilmer quit Swamp Root to become a cancer quack, by the way), which
      seemed to her to diagnose her case exactly. So she &lsquo;tanked up&rsquo;
      some more on that brand of intoxicant. Since she was constantly drugging
      herself, the natural resistance of her body was weakened, and she got a
      bad cold. The cough scared her almost to death; or rather, the consumption
      cure advertisements which she took to reading did; and she spent a few
      dollars on the fake factory which turns out Dr. King&rsquo;s New
      Discovery. This proving worthless, she switched to Piso&rsquo;s Cure and
      added the hasheesh habit to alcoholism. By this time she had acquired a
      fine, typical case of patent-medicine dyspepsia. That idea never occurred
      to her, though. She next tried Dr. Miles&rsquo;s Anti-Pain Pills (more
      acetanilid), and finally decided&mdash;having read some advertising
      literature on the subject&mdash;that she had cancer. And the reason she
      was leaving you, Mrs. Clyde, was that she had decided to go to a
      scoundrelly quack named Johnson who conducts a cancer institute in Kansas
      City, where he fleeces unfortunates out of their money on the pretense
      that he can cure cancer without the use of the knife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stop her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve stopped her! You&rsquo;ll find the remains of her
      patent medicines in the ash-barrel. I flatter myself I&rsquo;ve fixed <i>her</i>
      case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Sharpless gazed at him solemnly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Any doctor who
      claims to cure is a quack.&rsquo; Quotation from Dr. Strong,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly had me there,&rdquo; admitted he. &ldquo;Fortunately I didn&rsquo;t
      use the word &lsquo;cure.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a case of cure. It was a case
      of correcting a stupid, disastrous little blunder in mathematics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mathematics, eh?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Have you reached
      the point where you treat disease by algebra, and triangulate a patient
      for an operation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite that. But poor Maggie suffered all her troubles solely
      through an error in figuring by an incompetent man. A year ago she had
      trouble with her eyes. Instead of going to a good oculist she went to one
      of these stores which offer examinations free, and take it out in the
      price of the glasses. The examination is worth just what free things
      usually are worth&mdash;or less. They sold her a pair of glasses for two
      dollars. The glasses were figured out some fifty degrees wrong, for her
      error of vision, which was very slight, anyway. The nervous strain caused
      by the effort of the eyes to accommodate themselves to the false glasses
      and, later, the accumulated mass of drugs with which she&rsquo;s been
      insulting her insides, are all that&rsquo;s the matter with Maggie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, the glasses caused the headaches, and the patent medicines
      the stomach derangement,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the general break up, though the glasses may have started both
      before the nostrums ever got in their evil work. Nowadays, the wise
      doctor, having an obscure stomach trouble to deal with, in the absence of
      other explanation, looks to the eyes. Eyestrain has a most potent and
      far-reaching influence on digestion. I know of one case of chronic
      dyspepsia, of a year&rsquo;s standing, completely cured by a change of
      eyeglasses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a financial proposition,&rdquo; said Mr. Gormley, &ldquo;your
      nurse must have come out at the wrong end of the horn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; confirmed the doctor. &ldquo;She spent on patent
      medicines about forty dollars. The cancer quack would have got at least a
      hundred dollars out of her, not counting her railroad fare. Two hundred
      dollars would be a fair estimate of her little health-excursion among the
      quacks. Any good physician would have sent her to an oculist, who would
      have fitted proper glasses and saved all that expense and drugging. The
      entire bill for doctor, oculist, and glasses might have been twenty-five
      dollars. Yet they defend patent medicines on the ground that they&rsquo;re
      the &lsquo;poor man&rsquo;s doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gormley rose. &ldquo;Poor man&rsquo;s undertaker, rather,&rdquo; he
      amended. &ldquo;Well, having sufficiently blackguarded my own business, I
      think I&rsquo;ll go. Here&rsquo;s the whole thing summed up, as I see it.
      It pays to go to the doctor first and the druggist afterward; not to the
      druggist first and the doctor afterward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong walked over to the gate with him. On his return Mrs. Clyde
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an interesting, thoughtful man. Are most druggists like that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not all philosophers of the trade, like Gormley,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong, &ldquo;but they have to be pretty intelligent before they
      can pass the Pharmaceutical Board in this state, and put out their colored
      lights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often meant to ask what the green and red lights in
      front of a drug-store stand for,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;What is
      their derivation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Green is the official color of medical science,&rdquo; explained
      the doctor. &ldquo;The green flag, you know, indicates the hospital corps
      in war-time; and the degree of M.D. is signalized by a green hood in
      academic functions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the red globe on the other side of the store: what does that
      mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danger,&rdquo; replied Dr. Strong grimly.

      V.&mdash;THE MAGIC LENS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;N</span>o good
      fairy had ever bestowed such a gift as this magic lens,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Strong, whisking Bettina up from her seat by the window and setting her on
      his knee. &ldquo;It was most marvelously and delicately made, and
      furnished with a lightning-quick intelligence of its own. Everything that
      went on around it, it reported to its fortunate possessor as swiftly as
      thought flies through that lively little brain of yours. It earned its
      owner&rsquo;s livelihood for him; it gave him three fourths of his
      enjoyments and amusements; it laid before him the wonderful things done
      and being done all over the world; it guided all his life. And all that it
      required was a little reasonable care, and such consideration as a man
      would show to the horse that worked for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the beginning you said it wasn&rsquo;t a fairytale,&rdquo;
      accused Bettina, with the gravity which five years considers befitting
      such an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. Because the owner of the magic lens found that it obeyed all
      his orders so readily and faithfully, he began to impose on it. He made it
      work very hard when it was tired. He set tasks for it to perform under
      very difficult conditions. At times when it should have been resting, he
      compelled it to minister to his amusements. When it complained, he made
      light of its trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could it speak?&rdquo; inquired the little auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least it had a way of making known its wants. In everything
      which concerned itself it was keenly intelligent, and knew what was good
      and bad for it, as well as what was good and bad for its owner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it stop working for him if he was so bad to it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only as an extreme measure. But presently, in this case, it
      threatened to stop. So the owner took it to a cheap and poor repair-shop,
      where the repairer put a little oil in it to make it go on working. For a
      time it went on. Then, one morning, the owner woke up and cried out with a
      terrible fear. For the magic light in the magic lens was gone. So for that
      foolish man there was no work to do nor play to enjoy. The world was
      blotted out for him. He could not know what was going on about him, except
      by hearsay. No more was the sky blue for him, or the trees green, or the
      flowers bright; and the faces of his friends meant nothing. He had thrown
      away the most beautiful and wonderful of all gifts. Because it is a gift
      bestowed on nearly all of us, most of us forgot the wonder and the beauty
      of it. So, Honorable Miss Twinkles, do you beware how you treat the magic
      lens which is given to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me?&rdquo; cried the child; and then, with a little squeal of
      comprehension: &ldquo;Oh, I know! My eyes. That&rsquo;s the magic lens.
      Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about Bettykin&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Clyde, who had come in quietly, and had heard the finish of the allegory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been examining them,&rdquo; explained Dr. Strong,
      &ldquo;and the story was reward of merit for her going through with it
      like a little soldier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Examining her eyes? Any particular reason?&rdquo; asked the father
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very particular. Mrs. Clyde wishes to send her to kindergarten for
      a year before she enters the public school. No child ought to begin school
      without a thorough test of vision.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the test show in Bettykin&rsquo;s case?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing except the defects of heredity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heredity? My sight is pretty good; and Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s is still
      better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two are not the Cherub&rsquo;s only ancestors, however,&rdquo;
      smiled the physician. &ldquo;And you can hardly expect one or two
      generations to recast as delicate a bit of mechanism as the eye, which has
      been built up through millions of years of slow development. However,
      despite the natural deficiencies, there&rsquo;s no reason in Betty why she
      shouldn&rsquo;t start in at kindergarten next term, provided there isn&rsquo;t
      any in the kindergarten itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde studied the non-committal face of his &ldquo;Chinese physician,&rdquo;
      as he was given to calling Dr. Strong since the latter had undertaken to
      safeguard the health of his household on the Oriental basis of being paid
      to keep the family well and sound. &ldquo;Something is wrong with the
      school,&rdquo; he decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read what it says of itself in that first paragraph,&rdquo; replied
      Dr. Strong, handing him a rather pretentious little booklet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the prospectus of their &ldquo;new and scientific kindergarten,&rdquo;
      the Misses Sarsfield warmly congratulated themselves and their prospective
      pupils, primarily, upon the physical advantages of their school building
      which included a large work-and-play room, &ldquo;with generous window
      space on all sides, and finished throughout in pure, glazed white.&rdquo;
      This description the head of the Clyde household read over twice; then he
      stepped to the door to intercept Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s mother who was passing
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Grandma,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Our Chinese tyrant had
      diagnosed something wrong with that first page. Do you discover any kink
      in it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless, after reading it. &ldquo;Nor in
      the place itself. I called there yesterday. It is a beautiful room;
      everything as shiny and clean as a pin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday was cloudy,&rdquo; observed the Health Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was. Yet there wasn&rsquo;t a corner of the place that wasn&rsquo;t
      flooded with light,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on a clear day, with the sun pouring in from all sides and
      being flashed back from those shiny, white walls, the unfortunate inmates
      would be absolutely dazzled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that God&rsquo;s pure sunlight can hurt any one?&rdquo;
      challenged Mrs. Sharpless, who was rather given to citing the Deity as
      support for her own side of any question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of snow-blindness?&rdquo; countered the
      physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it in the North,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      not a pleasant thing to see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glazed white walls would give a very fair imitation of snow-glare.
      Too much light is as bad as too little. Those walls should be tinted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it says here,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, referring to his circular,
      &ldquo;that the &lsquo;Misses Sarsfield will conduct their institution on the
      most improved Froebelian principles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Froebel was a great man and a wise one,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;His kindergarten system has revolutionized all teaching. But he
      lived before the age of hygienic knowledge. I suppose that no other man
      has wrought so much disaster to the human eye as he.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty broad statement, Strong,&rdquo; objected Air.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? Look at the evidence. North Germany is the place where
      Froebel first developed his system. Seventy-five per cent of the
      population are defective of vision. Even the American children of North
      German immigrants show a distinct excess of eye defects. You&rsquo;ve seen
      the comic pictures representing Boston children as wearing huge goggles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you making an argument out of a funny-paper joke?&rdquo;
      queried Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It wouldn&rsquo;t be a joke if it hadn&rsquo;t some
      foundation in fact. The kindergarten system got its start in America in
      Boston. Boston has the worst eyesight of any American city; impaired
      vision has even become hereditary there. To return to Germany: if you want
      a shock, look up the records of suicides among school-children there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely that has no connection with the eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely it has,&rdquo; controverted Dr. Strong. &ldquo;The eye is
      the most nervous of all the organs; and nothing will break down the
      nervous system in general more swiftly and surely than eye-strain. Even in
      this country we are raising up a generation of neurasthenic youngsters,
      largely from neglect of their eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, we&rsquo;ve got to educate our children,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve got to take the utmost precautions lest the
      education cost more than it is worth, in acquired defects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; announced Grandma Sharpless, &ldquo;I believe
      in early schooling and in children learning to be useful. At the Sarsfield
      school there were little girls no older that Bettina, who were doing
      needlework beautifully; fine needlework at that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine needlework!&rdquo; exploded Dr. Strong in a tone which Grandma
      Sharpless afterwards described as &ldquo;damnless swearing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough! See here, Clyde. Betty goes to that
      kindergarten only over my dead job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, amazed at the quite unwonted
      excitement which the other exhibited, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re dealing in
      ultimatums, I&rsquo;ll drop out and leave the stricken field to Mrs.
      Clyde. This kindergarten scheme is hers. Wait. I&rsquo;ll bring her. I
      think she just came in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to fight with you about, Dr. Strong?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Clyde, appearing at the door, a vision of trim prettiness in her furs and
      veil. &ldquo;Tom didn&rsquo;t tell me the <i>casus belli</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody in this house,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong appealing to her,
      &ldquo;seems to deem the human eye entitled to the slightest
      consideration. You&rsquo;ve never worn glasses; therefore you must have
      respected your own eyesight enough to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped abruptly and scowled into Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You look
      as if you were going to bite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking cross-eyed for?&rdquo; the Health Master shot
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not! Oh, it&rsquo;s this veil, I suppose.&rdquo; She
      lifted the heavy polka-dotted screen and tucked it over her hat. &ldquo;There,
      that&rsquo;s more comfortable!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it!&rdquo; said the physician with an emphasis of sardonicism.
      &ldquo;You surprise me by admitting that much. How long have you been
      wearing that instrument of torture?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, two hours. Perhaps three. But, Dr. Strong, it doesn&rsquo;t
      hurt my eyes at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor your head?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>have</i> got a little headache,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;To
      think that a supposedly intelligent woman who has reached the age of&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-eight,&rdquo; said she, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      ashamed of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Thirty-eight, without having to wear glasses, should
      deliberately abuse her hard-working vision by distorting it! See here,&rdquo;
      he interrupted himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite evident that I haven&rsquo;t
      been living up to the terms of my employment. One of these evenings we&rsquo;re
      going to have in this household a short but sharp lecture and symposium on
      eyes. I&rsquo;ll give the lecture; and I suspect that this family will
      furnish the symposium&mdash;of horrible examples. Where&rsquo;s Julia? As
      she&rsquo;s the family Committee on School Conditions, I expect to get
      some material from her, too. Meantime, Mrs. Clyde, no kindergarten for
      Betty kin, if you please. Or, in any case, not that kindergarten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No further ocular demonstrations were made by Dr. Strong for several days.
      Then, one evening, he came into the library where the whole family was
      sitting. Grandma Sharpless, in the old-fashioned rocker, next a stand from
      which an old-fashioned student-lamp dispensed its benign rays, was holding
      up, with some degree of effort, a rather heavy book to the line of her
      vision. Opposite her a soft easychair contained Robin, other-wise Bobs,
      involuted like a currant-worm after a dose of Paris green, and
      imaginatively treading, with the feet of enchantment, virgin expanses of
      forest in the wake of Mr. Stewart White.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia, alias &ldquo;Junkum,&rdquo; his twin, was struggling against the
      demon of ill chance as embodied in a game of solitaire, far over in a dim
      corner. Geography enchained the mind of eight-year-old Charles, also his
      eyes, and apparently his nose, which was stuck far down into the mapped
      page. Near him his father, with chin doubled down over a stiff collar, was
      internally begging leave to differ with the editorial opinions of his
      favorite paper; while Mrs. Clyde, under the direct glare of a side-wall
      electric cluster, unshaded, was perusing a glazed-paper magazine, which
      threw upon her face a strong reflected light. Before the fire Bettykin was
      retailing to her most intelligent doll the allegory of the Magic Lens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter, upon this scene of domestic peace, the spirit of devastation in the
      person of the Health Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horrible examples being now on exhibit,&rdquo; he remarked from
      the doorway, &ldquo;our symposium on eyes will begin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says we&rsquo;re a hor&rsquo;ble example, Susan Nipper,&rdquo;
      said Bettina confidentially, to her doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I apologize, Bettykin,&rdquo; returned the doctor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      the only two sensible people in the room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia promptly rose, lifted the stand with her cards on it, carried it to
      the center of the library, and planted it so that the central light fell
      across it from a little behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One recruit to the side of common sense,&rdquo; observed the
      physician. &ldquo;Next!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Clyde, looking up.
      &ldquo;Newspaper print?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newspaper print is an unavoidable evil, and by no means the worst
      example of Gutenberg&rsquo;s art. No; the trouble with you is that your
      neck is so scrunched down into a tight collar as to shut off a proper
      blood supply from your head. Don&rsquo;t your eyes feel bungy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little. What am I going to do? I can&rsquo;t sit around after
      dinner with no collar on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit up straight, then; stick your neck up out of your collar and
      give it play. Emulate the attentive turtle! And you, Bobs, stop imitating
      an anchovy. Uncurl! <i>Uncurl!!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh, Robin straightened himself out. &ldquo;I was so comfortable,&rdquo;
      he complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you weren&rsquo;t. You were only absorbed. The veins on your
      temples are fairly bulging. You might as well try to read standing on your
      head. Get a straight-backed chair, and you&rsquo;re all right. I&rsquo;m
      glad to see that you follow Grandma Sharpless&rsquo;s good example in
      reading by a student-lamp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my own lamp,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;Seventy
      years has at least taught me how to read.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, but not what,&rdquo; answered the Health Master. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      a bad book you&rsquo;re reading.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Sharpless achieved the proud athletic feat of bounding from her
      chair without the perceptible movement of a muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a shaking voice, &ldquo;do you
      know what book that is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what book&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Bible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? Well, Heaven inspired the writer, but not the printer. Text
      such as that ought to be prohibited by law. Isn&rsquo;t there a passage in
      that Bible, &lsquo;Having eyes, ye see not&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;And my eyes
      have been seeing and seeing straight for a good many more years than
      yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more credit to them and the less to you, if you&rsquo;ve
      maltreated them with such sight-murdering print as that. Haven&rsquo;t you
      another Bible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Sharpless sat down again. &ldquo;I have another,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;with large print; but it&rsquo;s so heavy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prescription: one reading-stand. Now, Mrs. Clyde.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother of the family looked up from her magazine with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that I haven&rsquo;t large print or a good
      light,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The print is good, but the paper bad,&rdquo; said the Health
      Master. &ldquo;Bad, that is, as you are holding it under a full,
      unqualified electric light. In reading from glazed paper, which reflects
      like a mirror, you should use a very modified light. In fact, I blame
      myself from not having had all the electric globes frosted long since.
      Now, I&rsquo;ve kept the worst offender for the last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley detached his nose from his geography and looked up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      me, I suppose,&rdquo; he remarked pessimistically and ungrammatically.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always coming in for something special. But I can&rsquo;t
      make anything out of these old maps without digging my face down into
      &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a true bill against the book concern which turns out
      such a book, and the school board which permits its use. Charley, do you
      know why Manny isn&rsquo;t playing football this year?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manny&rdquo; was the oldest son of the family, then away at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother wanted him not to, I suppose,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Dr. Strong persuaded me that the
      development he would get out of the game would be worth the risk.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;It was his eyes,&rdquo; said the Health Master. &ldquo;He is
      wearing glasses this year and will probably wear them next. After that I
      hope he can stop them. But his trouble is that he&mdash;or rather his
      teachers&mdash;abused his eyes with just such outrageous demands as that
      geography of yours. And while the eye responded then, it is demanding
      payment now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a kid&rsquo;s got to study, hasn&rsquo;t he? Else he won&rsquo;t
      keep up,&rdquo; put in Bobs, much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at the expense of the most important of his senses,&rdquo;
      returned the Health Master. &ldquo;And never at night, at Charley&rsquo;s
      age, or even yours, Bobs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he gets dropped from his classes,&rdquo; objected Bobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more blame to his classes. Early learning is much too expensive
      at the cost of eye-strain and consequent nerve-strain. If we force a
      student in the early years to make too great demands on his eyes, the
      chances are that he will develop some eye or nervous trouble at sixteen or
      seventeen and lose far more time than he has gained before, not reckoning
      the disastrous physical effects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if other children go ahead, ours must,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the others who go ahead now won&rsquo;t keep ahead later.
      There is a sentence in Wood and Woodruff&rsquo;s textbook on the eye *
      which every public-school teacher and every parent should learn by heart.
      It runs like this: &lsquo;That child will be happier and a better citizen
      as well as a more successful man of affairs, who develops into a fairly
      healthy, though imperfectly schooled animal at twenty, than if he becomes
      a learned, neurasthenic asthenope at the same age.&rsquo;&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Antelope?&rdquo; put in Bettina, who was getting weary of her
      exclusion from the topic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a picture of that. It&rsquo;s
      a little deer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are you, Toddles,&rdquo; cried the doctor, seizing upon her with
      one hand and Susan Nipper with the other, and setting one on each
      shoulder, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re going to keep those very bright twinklers
      of yours just as fit&rsquo;as possible, both to see and be seen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of Charley and the twins?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything right, so far. They&rsquo;re healthy young animals and
      can meet the ordinary demands of school life. But no more study at night,
      for some years, for Charley; and no more, ever, of fine-printed maps. Some
      day, Charley, you may go to the Orinoco. It&rsquo;s a good deal more
      desirable that you should be able to see what there is to be seen there,
      then, than that you should learn, now, the name of every infinitesimally
      designated town on its banks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my childhood,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Sharpless, with the finality
      proper to that classic introductory phrase, &ldquo;we thought more of our
      brains than our eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An inverted principle. The brain can think for itself. The eye can
      only complain, and not always very clearly in the case of a child.
      Moreover, Mrs. Sharpless, in your school-days the eye wasn&rsquo;t under
      half the strain that it is in our modern, print-crowded world. The fact
      is, we&rsquo;ve made a tremendous leap forward, and radically changed a
      habit and practice built up through hundreds and thousands of years, and
      Nature is struggling against great difficulties to catch up with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you are getting at,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Clyde, letting her magazine drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you tried walking on all fours lately?&rdquo; inquired the
      physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a number of years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presumably you would find it awkward. Yet if, through some pressure
      of necessity, the human race should have to return to the quadrupedal
      method, the alteration in life would be less radical than we have imposed
      upon our vision in the last few generations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like flat nonsense to me,&rdquo; said the downright Clyde.
      &ldquo;We see just as all our ancestors saw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think again. Our ancestors, back a very few generations, were an
      outdoor race living in a world of wide horizons. Their eyes could range
      over far distances, unchecked, instead of being hemmed in most of the time
      by four walls. They were farsighted. Indeed, their survival depended upon
      their being far-sighted; like the animals which they killed or which
      killed them, according as the human or the beast had the best eyes.
      Nowadays, in order to live we must read and write. That is, the primal
      demand upon the eye is that it shall see keenly near at hand instead of
      far off. The whole hereditary training of the organ has been inverted, as
      if a mountaineer should be set to diving for pearls; and the poor thing
      hasn&rsquo;t had time to adjust itself yet. We employ our vision for close
      work ten times as much as we did a hundred years ago and ten thousand
      times as much as we did ten thousand years ago. But the influence of those
      ten thousand years is still strong upon us, and the human child is born
      with the eye of a savage or an animal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of an animal&rsquo;s eyes have I got?&rdquo; demanded
      Bettina. &ldquo;A antelope&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost as far-sighted,&rdquo; returned the Health Master, wriggling
      out from under her and catching her expertly as she fell. &ldquo;And how
      do you think an antelope would be doing fine needlework in a kindergarten?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Strong, few of us go blind,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;And
      of those who do, nearly half are needlessly so. That we aren&rsquo;t all
      groping, sightless, about the earth is due to the marvelous adaptability
      of our eyes. And it is exactly upon that adaptability that we are so prone
      to impose; working a willing horse to death. In the young the muscles of
      accommodation, whereby the vision is focused, are almost incredibly
      powerful; far more so than in the adult. The Cherub, here, could force her
      vision to almost any kind of work and the eye would not complain much&mdash;at
      this time. But later on the effects would be manifest. Therefore we have
      to watch the eye very closely until it begins to grow old, which is at
      about twelve years or so. In the adult the eye very readily lets its owner
      know if anything is wrong. Only fools disregard that warning. But in the
      developing years we must see to it that those muscles, set to the task of
      overcoming generations of custom, do not overwork and upset the whole
      nervous organization. Sometimes glasses are necessary; usually, only care.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few generations we&rsquo;ll all have four eyes, won&rsquo;t
      we?&rdquo; asked Bobs, making a pair of mock spectacles with his circled
      fingers and thumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s hope not. The cartoonists of prophecy always give
      the future man spectacles. But I believe that the tendency will be the
      other way, and that, by evolution to meet new conditions, the eye will fit
      itself for its work, unaided, in time. Meantime, we have to pay the
      penalty of the change. That&rsquo;s a small price for living in this
      wonderful century.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that half the blind are needlessly so,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Clyde. &ldquo;Is that from preventable disease?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About forty per cent, of the wholly blind. But the half-blind and
      the nervously wrecked victims of eye-strain owe their woes generally to
      sheer carelessness and neglect. By the way, eye-strain itself may cause
      very serious forms of disease, such as obstinate and dangerous forms of
      indigestion, insomnia, or even St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance and epilepsy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not telling us anything about eye diseases, Dr.
      Strong,&rdquo; said Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There speaks our Committee on School Conditions, filled full of
      information,&rdquo; said the Health Master with a smile. &ldquo;Junkum has
      made an important discovery, and made it in time. She has found that two
      children recently transferred from Number 14 have red eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve been crying,&rdquo; suggested Bettykin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were when I saw them, acute Miss Twinkles, although they didn&rsquo;t
      mean it at all. One was crying out of one eye, and one out of the other,
      which gave them a very curious, absurd, and interesting appearance. They
      had each a developing case of pink-eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horses have pink-eye, not people,&rdquo; remarked Grandma
      Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be more accurate, then, conjunctivitis. People have that; a
      great many people, once it gets started. It looks very bad and dangerous;
      but it isn&rsquo;t if properly cared for. Only, it&rsquo;s quite
      contagious. Therefore the Committee on Schools, with myself as acting
      executive, accomplished the temporary removal of those children from
      school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; the Committee joyously took up the tale, &ldquo;we
      went out and trailed the pink-eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did. We trailed it to its lair in School Number 14, and there we
      found one of the most dangerous creatures which civilization still allows
      to exist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the school?&rdquo; said Bettykin. &ldquo;Oo-oo! What was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a Rollertowl,&rdquo; replied the doctor impressively and in
      a sonorous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of it,&rdquo; said the Cherub, awestruck. &ldquo;What
      is it like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means a roller-towel, goosie,&rdquo; explained Julia. &ldquo;A
      towel on a roller, that everybody wipes their hands and faces on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. And because everybody uses it, any contagious disease that
      anybody has, everybody is liable to catch. I&rsquo;d as soon put a
      rattlesnake in a school as a roller-towel. In this case, half the grade
      where it was had conjunctivitis. But that isn&rsquo;t the worst. There was
      one case of trachoma in the grade; a poor little Italian whose parents
      ignorantly sent her to an optician instead of an oculist. The optician
      treated her for an ordinary inflammation, and now she will lose the sight
      of one eye. Meantime, if any of the others have been infected by her,
      through that roller-towel, there will be trouble, for trachoma is a
      serious disease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you throw out the roller-towel?&rdquo; asked Charley with a
      hopeful eye to a fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We got thrown out ourselves, didn&rsquo;t we, Junkum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty near,&rdquo; corroborated Julia. &ldquo;The principal told
      Dr. Strong that he guessed he could run his school himself and he didn&rsquo;t
      need any interference by&mdash;by&mdash;what did he call us, Dr. Strong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interlopers. No, Cherub, an interloper is no relation to an
      antelope. It was four days ago that we left that principal and went out
      and whistled for the Fool-killer. Yesterday, the principal came down with
      a rose-pink eye of his own; the Health Officer met him and ordered him
      into quarantine, and the terrible and ferocious Rollertowl is now writhing
      in its death-agonies on the ash-heap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about other diseases?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing from me. The eye will report them itself quick enough. And
      as soon as your eye tells you that anything is the matter with it, you
      tell the oculist, and you&rsquo;ll probably get along all right, as far as
      diseases go. It is not diseases that I have to worry about, as your
      Chinese-plan physician, so much as it is to see that you give your vision
      a fair chance. Let&rsquo;s see. Charley, you&rsquo;re the Committee on
      Air, aren&rsquo;t you? Could you take on a little more work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try me,&rdquo; said the boy promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; we&rsquo;ll make you the Committee on Air and Light,
      hereafter, with power of protest and report whenever you see your mother
      going out in a polka-dotted, cross-eyed veil, or your grandmother reading
      a Bible that needs burning worse than any heretic ever did, or any of the
      others working or playing without sufficient illumination. Here endeth
      this lecture, with a final word. This is it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eye is the most nervous of all the body&rsquo;s organs. Except
      in early childhood, when it has the recklessness and overconfidence of
      unbounded strength, it complains promptly and sharply of ill-usage. Now,
      there are a few hundred rules about when and how to use the eyes and when
      and how not to use them. I&rsquo;m not going to burden you with those. All
      I&rsquo;m going to advise you is that when your eyes burn, smart, itch, or
      feel strained, there&rsquo;s some reason for it, and you should obey the
      warning and stop urging them to work against their protest. In fact, I
      might sum it all up in a motto which I think I&rsquo;ll hang here in the
      library&mdash;a terse old English slang phrase.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mind your eye,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied the Health Master.

      VI.&mdash;THE RE-MADE LADY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all unfortunate times!&rdquo; lamented Mrs. Clyde, her piquant
      face twisted to an expression of comic despair. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t
      he have given us a little more notice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Impatiently she tossed aside the telegram which announced that her husband&rsquo;s
      old friend, Oren Taylor, the artist, would arrive at seven o&rsquo;clock
      that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it bother you, dear,&rdquo; said Clyde. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      take him to the club for dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t. Have you forgotten that I&rsquo;ve invited Louise
      Ennis for her quarterly&mdash;well&mdash;visitation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clyde whistled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a poser. What business have I
      got to have a cousin like Louise, anyway!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this disloyal observation Dr. Strong walked into the library. He was
      a very different Dr. Strong from the nerve-shaken wanderer who had dropped
      from nowhere into the Clyde household a year previous as its physician on
      the Chinese plan of being employed to keep the family well. The painful
      lines of the face were smoothed out. There was a deep light of content,
      the content of the man who has found his place and filled it, in the level
      eyes; and about the grave and controlled set of the mouth a sort of
      sensitive buoyancy of expression. The flesh had hardened and the spirit
      softened in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear that, Strong?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Clyde, turning to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have trained ears,&rdquo; answered Dr. Strong solemnly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      absolutely impervious to any speech not intended for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open them to this: Louise Ennis is invited for dinner to-night. So
      is my old friend Oren Taylor, who wires to say that he&rsquo;s passing
      through town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Taylor, the artist of &lsquo;The First Parting&rsquo;? I
      shall enjoy meeting him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t enjoy meeting Cousin Louise,&rdquo; declared
      Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;We ask her about four times a year, out of family piety.
      You&rsquo;ve been lucky to escape her thus far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a painful old party, your cousin?&rdquo; inquired the
      physician, smilingly, of Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old? Twenty-two,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;But she looks fifty
      and feels a hundred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allowing for feminine exaggeration,&rdquo; amended Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s so wrong with her?&rdquo; demanded the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nerves,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stomach,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Headaches,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toe-aches,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much money,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much ego,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dyspepsia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hypochondria.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chronic inertia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set it to music,&rdquo; suggested Dr. Strong, &ldquo;and sing it as
      a duet of disease, from ablepsy to zymosis, inclusively. I shall be
      immensely interested to observe this prodigy of ills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of opportunity,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde
      rather maliciously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to sit next to her at dinner
      to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then put Bettykin on the other side of me,&rdquo; he returned.
      &ldquo;With that combination of elf, tyrant, and angel close at hand, I
      can turn for relief from the grave to the cradle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you cannot. Louise can&rsquo;t endure children. She says
      they get on her nerves. <i>My</i> children!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you <i>have</i> put the finishing touch to your character
      sketch,&rdquo; observed Dr. Strong. &ldquo;A woman of child-bearing age
      who can&rsquo;t endure children&mdash;well, she is pretty far awry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I can remember Louise when she was a sweet, attractive young
      girl,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;That was before her mother died,
      and left her to the care of a father too busy making money to do anything
      for his only child but spend it on her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about Lou Ennis, I know,&rdquo; said Grandma
      Sharpless, who had entered in time to hear the closing words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said. Dr. Strong. &ldquo;What is our expert
      diagnostician&rsquo;s opinion of the case? You know I always defer to you,
      ma&rsquo;am, on any problem that&rsquo;s under the surface of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your soft sawder, young man!&rdquo; said the old lady, her
      shrewd, gray eyes twinkling from her shrewd, pink face. &ldquo;My opinion
      of Louise Ennis? I&rsquo;ll give it to you in two words. Just spoiled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taking my warning as I find it,&rdquo; remarked the physician,
      rising, &ldquo;I shall now retire to put on some chain armor under my
      evening coat, in case the Terrible Cousin attempts to stab me with an
      oyster-fork.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was not, as Mrs. Clyde was forced to admit afterward, by any
      means the dismal function which she had anticipated. Oren Taylor, an easy,
      discursive, humorous talker, set the pace and was ably seconded by Grandma
      Sharpless, whose knack of incisive and pointed comment served to spur him
      to his best. Dr. Strong, who said little, attempted to draw Miss Ennis
      into the current of talk, and was rewarded with an occasional flash of
      rather acid wit, which caused the artist to look across the table
      curiously at the girl. So far as he could do so without rudeness, the
      physician studied his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a tall, amply-built girl, with a slackened frame whose muscles had
      forgotten how to play their part properly in holding the structure firm.
      Her face was flaccid. Under the large but dull eyes, there was a bloodless
      puffiness. Discontent sat enthroned at the corners of the sensitive mouth.
      A faint, reddish eruption disfigured her chin. Her two strong assets,
      beautifully even teeth and a wealth of soft, fine hair, failed wholly to
      save her from being a flatly repellent woman. Dr. Strong noted further
      that her hands were incessantly uneasy, and that she ate little and
      without interest. Also she seemed, in a sullen way, shy. Yet, despite all
      of these drawbacks, there was a pathetic suggestion of inherent fineness
      about her; of qualities become decadent through disuse; a charm that
      should have been, thwarted and perverted by a slovenly habit of life. Dr.
      Strong set her down as a woman at war with herself, and therefore with her
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Mr. and Mrs. Clyde slipped away to see the children. The
      artist followed Dr. Strong, to whom he had taken a liking, as most men
      did, into the small lounging-room, where he lighted a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad about that Miss Ennis, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Taylor
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion looked at him interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a mess,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Such a ruin. Yet so much
      left that isn&rsquo;t ruined. That face would be worth a lot to me for the
      &lsquo;Poet&rsquo;s Cycle of the Months&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m painting
      now. What a <i>November</i> she&rsquo;d make; &lsquo;November, the withered
      mourner of glories dead and gone.&rsquo; Only I suppose she&rsquo;d resent
      being asked to sit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Illusions are the last assets that a woman loses,&rdquo; agreed Dr.
      Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; pursued the painter, &ldquo;of what her Maker
      meant her to be, and of how she has belied it! She&rsquo;s essentially and
      fundamentally a beautiful woman; that is why I want her for a model.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;In the structure of her face, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and all through. Look at the set of her shoulders, and the
      lines of her when she walks. Nothing jerry-built about her! She&rsquo;s
      got the contours of a goddess and the finish of a mud-pie. It&rsquo;s
      maddening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More maddening from the physician&rsquo;s point of view than from
      the artist&rsquo;s. For the physician knows how needless it all is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she your patient?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she were I&rsquo;d be ashamed to admit it. Give me military
      authority and a year&rsquo;s time and if I couldn&rsquo;t fix her so that
      she&rsquo;d be proud to pose for your picture&mdash;Good Heavens!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From behind the drapery of the passageway appeared Louise Ennis. She took
      two steps toward the two men and threw out her hands in an appeal which
      was almost grotesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; she cried, turning from one to the other.
      &ldquo;Tell me, is it really true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; groaned Taylor, &ldquo;what can I say to
      palliate my unpard&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevermind that! I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t care anything
      about it. It&rsquo;s my own fault. I stopped and listened. I couldn&rsquo;t
      help it. It means so much to me. You can&rsquo;t know. No man can
      understand. Is it true that I&mdash;that my face&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oren Taylor was an artist in more than his art: he possessed the rare
      sense of the fit thing to do and say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he answered quietly, &ldquo;that I have seen few
      faces more justly and beautifully modeled than yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she said, whirling upon Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Can you
      do what you said? Can you make me good-looking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I. But you yourself can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how? What must I do? D&mdash;d&mdash;don&rsquo;t think me a
      fool!&rdquo; She was half-sobbing now. &ldquo;It may be silly to long so
      bitterly to be beautiful. But I&rsquo;d give anything short of life for
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not silly at all,&rdquo; returned Dr. Strong emphatically. &ldquo;On
      the contrary, that desire is rooted in the profoundest depths of sex.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is the best excuse for art as a profession,&rdquo; said the
      painter, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only tell me what to do,&rdquo; she besought. &ldquo;Gently,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done in a day. And it will be a
      costly process.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. If money is all&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t all. It&rsquo;s only a drop in the bucket. It will
      cost you dear in comfort, in indulgence, in ease, in enjoyment, in habit&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll obey like a child.&rdquo; Again her hands went
      tremulously out to him; then she covered her face with them and burst into
      the tears of nervous exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no place for me,&rdquo; said the artist, and was about to
      escape by the door, when Mrs. Clyde blocked his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are in here,&rdquo; she said gayly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been
      wondering&mdash;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter? What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been an unfortunate blunder,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong
      quickly. &ldquo;I said some foolish things which Miss Ennis overheard&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted the painter. &ldquo;The fault was mine&mdash;&rdquo;
      And in the same breath Louise Ennis cried:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t overhear! I listened. I eavesdropped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite mad, all of you?&rdquo; demanded the hostess. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
      somebody tell me what has happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the girl wildly; &ldquo;every word
      they said. I <i>am</i> a mess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s arms went around the girl. Sex-loyalty raised its war
      signal flaring in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who</i> said that?&rdquo; she demanded, in a tone of which Dr.
      Strong observed afterward, &ldquo;I never before heard a woman roar under
      her breath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind who said it,&rdquo; retorted the girl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      true anyway. It wasn&rsquo;t meant to hurt me. It didn&rsquo;t hurt me. He
      is going to cure me; Dr. Strong is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cure you, Louise? Of what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of ugliness. Of hideousness. Of being a mess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; said the older woman softly, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
      take it to heart so, the idle word of some one who doesn&rsquo;t know you
      at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; retorted the other passionately.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been pretty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A compliment straight from the heart,&rdquo; murmured the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color came into Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s smooth cheek again. &ldquo;What
      have you promised her, Dr. Strong?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I have simply followed Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s lead. His is the
      artist eye that can see beauty beneath disguises. He has told Miss Ennis
      that she was meant to be a beautiful woman. I have told her that she can
      be what she was meant to be if she wills, and wills hard enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will take charge of her case?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, of course, depends upon you and Mr. Clyde. If you will
      include Miss Ennis in the family, my responsibilities will automatically
      extend to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;And now, Mr. Taylor,&rdquo;
      she added, answering a look of appeal from that uncomfortable gentleman,
      &ldquo;come and see the sketches. I really believe they are Whistler&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they left, Dr. Strong looked down at Louise Ennis with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present I prescribe a little cold water for those eyes,&rdquo;
      said he. &ldquo;And then some general conversation in the drawing-room.
      Come here tomorrow at four.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I want to begin at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So as to profit by the impetus of the first enthusiasm? Very well.
      How did you come here this evening?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my limousine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell my new car? At this time of year?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Store it, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And go about on street-cars, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Walk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when it rains?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagerness died out of Louise Ennis&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo;
      she said pettishly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that old, old exercise treatment.
      Well, I&rsquo;ve tried that, and if you think&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped in surprise, for Dr. Strong, walking over to the door, held
      the portière aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you,&rdquo; he said courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all the advice you have for me?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said sulkily. &ldquo;What is it
      you want me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he interrupted in uncompromising tones. &ldquo;I
      am sure they are waiting for us in the other room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are treating me like a spoiled child,&rdquo; declared Miss
      Ennis, stamping a period to the charge with her high French heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She marched out of the room, and, with the physician, joined the rest of
      the company. For the remainder of the evening she spoke little to any one
      and not at all to Dr. Strong. But when she came to say good-night he was
      standing apart. He held out his hand, which she could not well avoid
      seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you get up to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;look in the
      mirror, [she winced] and say, &lsquo;I can be beautiful if I want to hard
      enough.&rsquo; Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon at the Clydes&rsquo; next day was given up to a family discussion
      of Miss Louise Ennis, precipitated by Mr. Clyde, who rallied Dr. Strong on
      his newest departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned beauty doctor, have you?&rdquo; he taunted good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trainer, rather,&rdquo; answered Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might be in better business,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Sharpless,
      with her customary frankness. &ldquo;Beauty is only skin-deep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandma Sharpless&rsquo;s quotations,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Strong to
      the saltcellar, &ldquo;are almost as sure to be wrong as her observations
      are to be right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a wiser man than you or I who spoke that truth about beauty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Beauty only skin-deep, indeed! It&rsquo;s liver-deep
      anyway. Often it&rsquo;s soul-deep. Do you think you&rsquo;ve kept your
      good looks, Grandma Sharpless, just by washing your skin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try to dodge the issue by flattery, young man,&rdquo;
      said the old lady, the more brusquely in that she could see her son-in-law
      grinning boyishly at the mounting color in her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as
      the Lord made me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as you&rsquo;ve kept yourself, by clean, sound living. Miss
      Ennis isn&rsquo;t as the Lord made her or meant her. She&rsquo;s a mere
      parody of it. Her basic trouble is an ailment much more prevalent among
      intelligent people than they are willing to admit. In the books it is
      listed under various kinds of hyphenated neurosis; but it&rsquo;s real
      name is fool-in-the-head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curable?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Clyde solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no known specific except removing the seat of the
      trouble with an axe,&rdquo; announced Dr. Strong. &ldquo;But cases
      sometimes respond to less heroic treatment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this case, I fear,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Louise will
      coddle herself into the idea that you have grossly insulted her. She won&rsquo;t
      come back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;Insult or
      no insult, she would come to the bait that Dr. Strong has thrown her if
      she had to crawl on her knees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Come she did, prompt to the hour. From out the blustery February day she
      lopped into the physician&rsquo;s pleasant study, slumped into a chair,
      and held out to him a limp left hand, palm up and fingers curled.
      Ordinarily the most punctilious of men, Dr. Strong did not move from his
      stance before the fire. He looked at the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to feel my pulse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor take my temperature?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor look at my tongue?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. I have a quite sufficient idea of what it looks
      like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was almost brutal. Miss Ennis began to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a m&mdash;m&mdash;mess, I know,&rdquo; she blubbered.
      &ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t keep telling me so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mess can be cleared up,&rdquo; said he more kindly, &ldquo;under
      orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you tell me, if only&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! There will be no &lsquo;if&rsquo; about it. You will do as
      you are bid, or we will drop the case right here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Don&rsquo;t drop me. I will. I promise. Only, please tell
      me what is the matter with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong, smiling inwardly, recalled the diagnosis he had announced to
      the Clydes, but did not repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know there must be. I have such strange symptoms. You can&rsquo;t
      imagine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fumbling in her hand-bag she produced a very elegant little notebook with
      a gold pencil attached. Dr. Strong looked at it with fascinated but
      ominous eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve jotted down some of the symptoms here,&rdquo; she
      continued, &ldquo;just as they occurred. You see, here&rsquo;s Thursday.
      That was a heart attack&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see that book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed it to him. He carefully took the gold pencil from its socket
      and returned it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, is there anything in this but symptoms? Any addresses that you
      want to keep?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one: the address of a freckle and blemish remover.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come to that later. Meantime&mdash;&rdquo; He tossed
      the book into the heart of the coal fire where it promptly curled up and
      perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo; gasped the visitor,&mdash;&ldquo;how
      dare you? What do you mean? That is an ivory-bound, gold-mounted book. It&rsquo;s
      valuable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, I believe, that the treatment would be expensive. This
      is only the beginning. Of all outrageous, unforgivable kinds of
      self-coddling, the hypochondria that keeps its own autobiography is the
      worst.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Regrettable though it is to chronicle, Miss Ennis hereupon emitted a
      semi-yelp of rage and beat the floor with her high French heels. Instantly
      the doctor&rsquo;s gaze shifted to her feet. Just how it happened she
      could not remember, but her right foot, unprotected, presently hit the
      floor with a painful thump, while the physician contemplated the shoe
      which he had deftly removed therefrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two inches and a half at least, that heel,&rdquo; he observed.
      &ldquo;Talk about the Chinese women torturing their feet!&rdquo; He laid
      the offending article upon the hearth, set his own soundly shod foot upon
      it, and tweaked off two inches of heel with the fire-tongs. &ldquo;Not so
      pretty,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but at least you can walk, and not
      tittup in that. Give me the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shocked and astounded into helplessness, she mechanically obeyed. He
      performed his rough-and-ready repairs, and handed it back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of walking,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;have you stored
      your automobile yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After to-morrow I don&rsquo;t want you to set foot in it. Now,
      then, we&rsquo;re going to put you through a course of questioning. Ready?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ennis settled back in her chair, with the anticipatory expression of
      one to whom the recital of her own woe is a lingering pleasure. &ldquo;Perhaps
      if I told you,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;just how I feel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that. Do you drink?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; The answer came back on the rebound. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;
      Dr. Strong leaned over her. She turned her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked me as if you meant I was a drunkard,&rdquo; she
      complained. &ldquo;Once in a while, when I have some severe nervous strain
      to undergo, I need a stimulant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Cocktail?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A mild one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mild cocktail! That&rsquo;s a paradox I&rsquo;ve never
      encountered. How often do you take these mild cocktails?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just occasionally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a meal is an occasion. Before meals?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; she admitted reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have one here last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you ate almost nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just it, you see. I need something: otherwise I have no
      appetite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, you have formed a drink habit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. Strong!&rdquo; It was half reproach, half insulted
      innocence, that wail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a cocktail&mdash;or two&mdash;or three,&rdquo; he looked at
      her closely, but she would not meet his eyes, &ldquo;you eat pretty well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then go to bed with a headache because you&rsquo;ve stimulated
      your appetite to more food than your run-down mechanism can rightly
      handle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do have a good many headaches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do anything for them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I take some harmless powders, sometimes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harmless, eh? A harmless headache powder is like a mild cocktail.
      It doesn&rsquo;t exist. So you&rsquo;re adding drug habit to drink habit.
      Fortunately, it isn&rsquo;t hard to stop. It has begun to show on you
      already, in that puffy grayness under the eyes. All the coal-tar powders
      vitiate the blood as well as affect the heart. Sleep badly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very often.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take anything for that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean opiates? I&rsquo;m not a fool, Doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you haven&rsquo;t gone quite that far,&rdquo; said the
      other grimly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve started in on two habits; but not the
      worst. Well, that&rsquo;s all. Come back when you need to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ennis&rsquo;s big, dull eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
      going to give me anything? Any medicine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or any advice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong permitted himself a little smile at the success of his
      strategy. &ldquo;Give it to yourself,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;You
      showed, in flashes, during the dinner talk last night, that you have both
      wit and sense, when you choose to use them. Do it now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl squirmed uncomfortably. &ldquo;I suppose you want me to give up
      cocktails,&rdquo; she murmured in a die-away voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And try to get along with no stimulants at all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. Fresh air and exercise ad lib.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to stop the headache powders?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right; go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to stop thinking about my symptoms?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I didn&rsquo;t reckon on your inherent sense in vain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to walk where I have been riding?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rain or shine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about diet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the plain food you want, at any time you really want it,
      provided you eat slowly and chew thoroughly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A la Fletcher?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horace Fletcher is one of those fine fanatics whose extravagances
      correct the average man&rsquo;s stolid stupidities. I&rsquo;ve seen his
      fad made ridiculous, but never harmful. Try it out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t tell me when to come back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you need to, I said. The moment the temptation to break over
      the rules becomes too strong, come. And&mdash;eh&mdash;by the way&mdash;eh&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      worry about your mirror for a while.&rdquo; Temporarily content with this,
      the new patient went away with new hope. Wiping his brow, the doctor
      strolled into the sitting-room where he found the family awaiting him with
      obvious but repressed curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t ethical, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;to
      discuss a patient&rsquo;s case with outsiders?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not outsiders. And she&rsquo;s not my patient, in the
      ordinary sense, since I&rsquo;m giving my services free. Moreover, I need
      all the help I can get.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can <i>I</i> do?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde promptly. &ldquo;Drop
      in at her house from time to time, and cheer her up. I don&rsquo;t want
      her to depend upon me exclusively. She has depended altogether too much on
      doctors in the past.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde chuckled. &ldquo;Did she tell you that the European medical
      faculty had chased her around to every spa on the Continent? Neurasthenic
      dyspepsia, they called it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty name! Seventy per cent of all dyspeptics have the seat of
      the imagination in the stomach. The difficulty is to divert it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your plan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve several, when the time comes. For the present I&rsquo;ve
      got to get her around into condition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoiled mind, spoiled body,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. And I&rsquo;m going to begin on the body, because that is
      the easiest to set right. Look out for an ill-tempered cousin during the
      next fortnight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His prophecy was amply confirmed by Mrs. Clyde, who made it her business,
      amid multifarious activities, to drop in upon Miss Ennis with patient
      frequency. On the tenth day of the &ldquo;cure,&rdquo; Mrs. Clyde reported
      to the household physician:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I go there again I shall probably <i>slap</i> her. She&rsquo;s
      become simply unbearable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Fine! She has had the nerve to
      stick to the rules. We needn&rsquo;t overstrain her, though. I&rsquo;ll
      have her come here tomorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening of the eleventh day, the
      patient stamped into the office, wet, bedraggled, and angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You made me store my motor-car.
      All the street-cars were crowded. My umbrella turned inside out. I&rsquo;m
      a perfect drench. And I know I&rsquo;ll catch my death of cold.&rdquo;
      Whereupon she laid a pathetic hand on her chest and coughed hollowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick out your foot,&rdquo; ordered Dr. Strong. And, as she obeyed:
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well. Good, sensible storm shoes. I&rsquo;ll risk your
      taking cold. How do you feel? Better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Worse!&rdquo; she snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; he retorted with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is more,&rdquo; she declared savagely, &ldquo;I look worse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your mirror has been failing in its mission of flattery. Too
      bad. Now take off your coat, sit right there by the fire, and in an hour
      you&rsquo;ll be dry as toast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour? I can&rsquo;t stay an hour!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s six o&rsquo;clock. I must go home. Besides,&rdquo; she
      added unguardedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half starved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Indeed!</i> Had a cocktail to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Certainly not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you have an appetite. A bad sign. Oh, a very bad sign&mdash;for
      the cocktail market.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired all the time. And I wake up in the morning with
      hardly any strength to get out of bed&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the inclination? Which?&rdquo; broke in the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my heart gives the queerest jumps and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought we&rsquo;d thrown that symptom-book into the fire. Stand
      up, please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood. Dr. Strong noted with satisfaction how, already, the lithe and
      well-set figure had begun to revert to its natural pose, showing that the
      muscles were beginning to do their work. He also noted that the hands,
      hitherto a mere <i>mélange</i> of nervously writhing fingers, hung easily
      slack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your troubles,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, &ldquo;have only just
      begun. I think you&rsquo;re strong enough now to begin work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she protested, half weeping. &ldquo;I feel
      faint this minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, healthy hunger. Of course, if a glance in your mirror
      convinces you that you&rsquo;ve had enough of the treatment&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ennis said something under her breath which sounded very much like
      &ldquo;Brute!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever had a good sweat?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips curled superciliously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not given to
      perspiration, I&rsquo;m thankful to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say &lsquo;perspire&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired he. &ldquo;I
      understood myself to say &lsquo;sweat.&rsquo; Have you ever&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High time you began. Buy yourself the heaviest sweater you can find&mdash;you
      may call it a &lsquo;perspirationer&rsquo; if you think the salesman will
      appreciate your delicacy&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll be around to-morrow and set
      up a punching-bag for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A device which you strike at. The blow forces it against a board
      and it returns and, unless you dodge nimbly, impinges upon your
      countenance. In other words, whacks you on the nose. Prizefighters use it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you want me to be like a prizefighter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most beautiful pink-and-white skin and the clearest eye I&rsquo;ve
      ever seen belonged to a middleweight champion. Yes, I&rsquo;d like to see
      you exactly like him in that respect. One hour every day&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t. I shan&rsquo;t have time. With the walking I
      do now I&rsquo;m busy all the morning and dead tired all the afternoon;
      and in the evening there is my bridge club&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you play bridge. For money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally we don&rsquo;t play for counters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d give it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not employed as a censor of my morals, Dr. Strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;ve undertaken to censor your nerves. And gambling,
      for a woman in your condition, is altogether too much of a strain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The corners of Miss Ennis&rsquo;s mouth quivered babyishly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sure, then, that working like a prizefighter will be too much strain. You&rsquo;re
      wearing me out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a cruel tyrant,&rdquo; mocked Dr. Strong; &ldquo;and
      worse is to come. We&rsquo;ll clear out a room in your house and put in
      not only the punching-bag, but also pulleys and a rowing-machine. And I&rsquo;ll
      send up an athletic instructor to see that you use them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have him. I&rsquo;ll send him away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By advice of your mirror?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ennis frankly and angrily wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret about yourself.&rdquo; Miss Ennis
      stopped weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ninety-nine cases out of a hundred I couldn&rsquo;t handle as I am
      handling your case. They would need a month&rsquo;s rest and building up
      before they&rsquo;d be fit for real work. But you are naturally a
      powerful, muscular woman with great physical endurance and resiliency.
      What I am trying to do is to take advantage of your splendid equipment to
      pull you out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do with the ordinary case?&rdquo; asked the girl,
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, put her to bed, perhaps. Perhaps send her away to the woods.
      Maybe set a nurse over her to see that she didn&rsquo;t take to writing
      her symptoms down in a book. Keep her on a rigid diet, and build her up by
      slow and dull processes. You may thank your stars that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t thank my stars at all!&rdquo; broke in the patient,
      as her besetting vice of self-pity asserted itself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much
      rather do that than be driven like a galley-slave. I&rsquo;m too tired to
      get any pleasure out of anything&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even bridge?&rdquo; interposed the tormentor softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and when night comes I fall into bed like a helpless log.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best news I&rsquo;ve heard yet. You&rsquo;re
      progressing. Now take that new appetite of yours home to dinner. And don&rsquo;t
      spoil it by eating too fast. Good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully a fortnight later Grandma Sharpless met Dr. Strong in the hallway as
      he came in from a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing to Louise Ennis?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots of things. What&rsquo;s wrong now? Another fit of the sulks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; said the old lady in a stage whisper. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      got <i>paint</i> on her face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong laughed. &ldquo;Really? It might be worse. In fact, as a
      symptom, it couldn&rsquo;t be better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, do you mean to tell me that face-paint is a good thing
      for a young woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. It&rsquo;s vulgar and tawdry, as a practice. But I&rsquo;m
      glad to know that Miss Ennis has turned to it, because it shows that she
      recognizes her own improvement and is trying to add to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the stuff will ruin her skin,&rdquo; cried the scandalized old
      lady. &ldquo;See what dreadful faces women have who use it. Look at the
      actresses&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look at them!&rdquo; broke in the physician. &ldquo;There is
      no class of women in the world with such beautiful skin as the women of
      the stage. And that in spite of hard work, doubtful habits of eating, and
      irregular hours. Do you know why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll tell me that paint does it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Sharpless with a sniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the paint itself. But the fact that in putting it on and taking
      it off, they maintain a profound cleanliness of skin which the average
      woman doesn&rsquo;t even understand. The real value of the successful
      skin-lotions and creams so widely exploited lies in the massage which
      their use compels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aside from the stuff on her face,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Sharpless,
      &ldquo;Louise looks like another woman, and acts like one. She came
      breezing in here like a young cyclone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means trouble,&rdquo; sighed Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Now that her
      vitality is returning, it will demand something to feed on. Well, we shall
      see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his patient standing&mdash;not sitting, this time&mdash;before
      the fireplace, with a face of gloom. Before he could greet her, she burst
      out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long am I to be kept on the grind? I see nobody. I have nothing
      to amuse me. I&rsquo;ve had a row with father.&rdquo; Dr. Strong smiled.
      &ldquo;The servants are impertinent.&rdquo; The smile broadened. &ldquo;The
      whole world is hateful!&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s face was now expanded
      into a positive grin. &ldquo;I despise everything and everybody! I&rsquo;m
      bored.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passing that over for the moment for something less important,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong smoothly, &ldquo;where do you buy your paint?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t paint!&rdquo; retorted the girl hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your rouge. Your skin-rejuvenator. Your essence of bloom of
      youth or whatever poetic name you call it by. Let me see the box.&rdquo;
      Mutiny shone from the scowling face, but her hand went to her reticule and
      emerged with a small box. It passed to the physician&rsquo;s hand and
      thence to the fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use paint if I want to,&rdquo;
      declared the girl. &ldquo;Undoubtedly. But you&rsquo;ll use good paint if
      you use any. Get a theatrical paper, read the ads, and send for the
      highest grade of grease-paint. I won&rsquo;t say anything about the
      vulgarity of the practice because I&rsquo;m not censoring your manners. I&rsquo;ll
      only state that three months from now you won&rsquo;t want or need paint.
      Did you get this stuff,&rdquo; he nodded toward the fireplace whence
      issued a highly perfumed smoke, &ldquo;from that address in your deceased
      symptom-book?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the firm which advertised to remove pimples, wasn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ennis shrank. &ldquo;Pimple is an inexcusable word,&rdquo; she
      protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Word? We&rsquo;re dealing in realities now. And pimples were an
      inexcusable reality in your case, because they were the blossoms of
      gluttony, torpor, and self-indulgence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward and looked closely at her chin. The surface, once
      blotched and roughened, was now of a smooth and soft translucency. &ldquo;You
      once objected to the word &lsquo;sweat,&rsquo;&rdquo; he continued.
      &ldquo;Well, it has eliminated the more objectionable word &lsquo;pimple&rsquo;
      from your reckoning. And it has done the job better than your
      blemish-remover&mdash;-which leaves scars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand went to her temple, where there was a little group of
      silvery-white patches on the skin. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you fix that?&rdquo;
      she asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Your &lsquo;remover&rsquo; was corrosive sublimate. It
      certainly removed the blemish. It would also have removed your entire face
      if you had used enough of it. Nothing can restore what the liquid fire has
      burned away. That&rsquo;s the penalty you pay for foolish credulousness.
      Fortunately, it is where it won&rsquo;t show much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloom surged back into her face. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any
      difference,&rdquo; she fretted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still a mess in looks
      even if I don&rsquo;t feel so much like one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One half of looks is expression,&rdquo; stated the doctor
      didactically. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like yours. What&rsquo;s your religion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His patient stared. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m a Presbyterian, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You suppose! It doesn&rsquo;t seem to have struck in very
      hard. Any objection to going to a Christian Science church?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christian Science! I thought the regular doctors considered it the
      worst kind of quackery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The regular doctors,&rdquo; returned Dr. Strong quickly, &ldquo;once
      considered anaesthesia, vaccination, and the germ theory as quackery. We
      live and learn, like others. There&rsquo;s plenty of quackery in Christian
      Science, and also quite a little good. And nowadays we&rsquo;re learning
      to accept the good in new dogmas, and discard the bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really wish me to go to the Christian Science church?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You&rsquo;ll encounter there a few wild fanatics. I&rsquo;ll
      trust your hard common sense to guard you against their proselytizing. You&rsquo;ll
      also meet a much larger number of sweet, gentle, and cheerful people, with
      a sweet, helpful, and cheerful philosophy of life. That&rsquo;ll help to
      cure you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will they cure me of, since you say I have no disease?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll cure you of turning your mouth down at the corners
      instead of up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, the mouth referred to did, indeed, turn up at the corners, but in
      no very pleasant wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think they&rsquo;ll amuse me?&rdquo; she inquired
      contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as for amusement, I&rsquo;ve arranged for that. You&rsquo;re
      bored. Very well, I expected it. It&rsquo;s a symptom, and a good one, in
      its place. I&rsquo;ll get you a job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! And if I don&rsquo;t want a job?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what you want. You need it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settlement work, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so mild. Garbage inspection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Louise Ennis closed her eyes in expectation of a qualm
      of disgust. The qualm didn&rsquo;t materialize. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with me?&rdquo; she asked in naïve and suppressed chagrin. &ldquo;I
      ought to feel&mdash;well, nauseated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Your nerves and stomach have found their poise. That&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do I know about garbage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it when you see it, don&rsquo;t you? Now, listen. There
      has been a strike of the city teamsters. Dr. Merritt, the Health Officer,
      wants volunteers to inspect the city and report on where conditions are
      bad from day to day. You&rsquo;ve got intelligence. You can outwalk nine
      men out of ten. And you can be of real service to the city. Besides, it&rsquo;s
      doctor&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of Louise Ennis&rsquo;s part in the great garbage strike, and of
      her subsequent door-to-door canvass of housing conditions, has no place in
      this account. After the start, Dr. Strong saw little of her; but he heard
      much from Mrs. Clyde, who continued her frequent visits to the Ennis
      household; not so much, as she frankly admitted, for the purpose of
      furnishing bulletins to Dr. Strong, as because of her own growing interest
      in and affection for the girl. And, as time went on, Strong noticed that,
      on the occasions when he chanced to meet his patient on the street, she
      was usually accompanied by one or another of the presentable young men of
      the community, a fact which the physician observed with professional
      approval rather than personal gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t her health alone,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde, when they
      were discussing her, one warm day in the ensuing summer. &ldquo;These six
      months seem to have made a new person of her. Trust the children to find
      out character. Bettykins wants to spend half her time with Cousin Lou.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve surely worked a transformation, Strong,&rdquo; said
      Clyde. &ldquo;But, of course, the raw material was there. You couldn&rsquo;t
      do much for the average homely woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The average woman isn&rsquo;t homely,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got good looks either spoiled or undeveloped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true,&rdquo; confirmed Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Any young woman
      whose face isn&rsquo;t actually malformed can find her place in the
      eternal scheme of beauty if she tries. Nature works toward beauty in all
      matters of sex. Where beauty doesn&rsquo;t exist it is merely an error in
      Nature&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the world is pretty full of errors,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of them aren&rsquo;t Nature&rsquo;s errors. They are the
      mistakes of the foolish human. Take almost any woman, not past the age of
      development, build up her figure to be supple and self-sustaining; give
      her a clear eye, quick-moving blood, fresh skin, and some interest in the
      game of life that shall keep mind and body alert&mdash;why, the radiant
      force of her abounding health would make itself felt in a blind asylum.
      And all this she can do for herself, with a little knowledge and a good
      deal of will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t exactly beauty, is it?&rdquo; asked Clyde,
      puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? In the soundest sense, I think it is. Anyway, put
      it this way: No woman who is wholly healthy, inside and out, can fail to
      be attractive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that painter-man could see Louise now, as an example,&rdquo;
      said Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oren Taylor?&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Why, he can. He goes
      East next week, and I&rsquo;ll wire him to stop over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oren Taylor arrived late on a warm afternoon. As he crossed the lawn,
      Louise Ennis was playing &ldquo;catch&rdquo; with Manny Clyde. Her figure
      swung and straightened with the lithe muscularity of a young animal. Her
      cheek was clear pink, deepening to the warmer color of the curved lips.
      The blue veins stood out a little against the warm, moist temples from
      which she brushed a vagrant lock of hair. Her eyes were wide and lustrous
      with the eager effort of the play, for the boy was throwing wide in
      purposeful delight over her swift gracefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the artist, staring at her. &ldquo;Who
      did that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong did that,&rdquo; explained Clyde; &ldquo;as per
      specifications.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A triumph!&rdquo; declared Taylor. &ldquo;A work of art.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong; &ldquo;a renewal of Nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case, a lady remade and better than new. My profound
      felicitations, Dr. Strong.&rdquo; He walked over to the flushed and lovely
      athlete. &ldquo;Miss Ennis,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;I want your
      permission to stay over to-morrow and sketch you. I need you in my &lsquo;Poet&rsquo;s
      Cycle of the Months.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Taylor?&rdquo; she returned demurely. &ldquo;Of
      course you can sketch me, if it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with my working
      hours.&rdquo; A quick smile rippled across her face like sunlight across
      water. &ldquo;The same subject?&rdquo; she asked with mischievous
      nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not even the same season,&rdquo; he replied emphatically,
      coloring, as he bethought him of his &ldquo;November, the withered mourner
      of glories dead and gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What part am I to play now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Dr. Strong name it,&rdquo; said Taylor with quick tact. &ldquo;He
      has prepared the model.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned to the physician, a little deeper tinge of color in her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Referred to Swinburne,&rdquo; said Strong lightly, and quoted:&mdash;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;W</span>ell?&rdquo;
      questioned Mrs. Clyde, facing the Health Master haggardly, as he entered
      the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; he protested with his reassuring smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      take it so tragically. You&rsquo;ve got a pretty sick-looking boy there.
      But any thoroughgoing fever makes a boy of nine pretty sick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fever?&rdquo; demanded the mother. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with what it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;and thank Heaven.
      It isn&rsquo;t typhoid. And it isn&rsquo;t diphtheria.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s scarlet fever,&rdquo; broke in her mother, Mrs.
      Sharpless, who had followed the doctor into the room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      what it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clyde shuddered at the name. &ldquo;Has he got the rash?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But he will have to-morrow,&rdquo; stated the old lady
      positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, too, Dr. Strong?&rdquo; Mrs. Clyde appealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept Grandma Sharpless&rsquo;s judgment,&rdquo;
      answered the physician. &ldquo;She has seen more scarlet fever in her time
      than I, or most physicians. And experience is the true teacher of
      diagnosis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t be sure!&rdquo; persisted Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;How
      can you tell without the rash?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in any way that I could put into words,&rdquo; said her mother.
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something in the look of the throat and something
      about the eyes and skin&mdash;Well, I can&rsquo;t describe it, but I know
      it as I know my own name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There speaks the born diagnostician,&rdquo; observed the Health
      Master. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the verdict must stand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then,&rdquo; faltered Mrs. Clyde, &ldquo;we must act at
      once. I&rsquo;ll call up my husband at the factory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; inquired Dr. Strong innocently. &ldquo;Why, to let
      him know, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. When I undertook to act as Chinese-plan physician to
      the Clyde household, I was not only to guard the family against illness as
      well as I could, but also to save them worry. This is Saturday. Mr. Clyde
      has had a hard, trying week in the factory. Why break up his day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clyde drew a long breath and her face lightened. &ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t
      a serious case?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarlet fever is always serious. Any disease which thoroughly
      poisons the system is. But there&rsquo;s no immediate danger; and there
      shouldn&rsquo;t be much danger at any time to a sturdy youngster like
      Charley, if he&rsquo;s well looked after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the other children!&rdquo; Mrs. Clyde turned to Mrs. Sharpless.
      &ldquo;Where can we send them, mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere.&rdquo; It was the doctor who answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely we can&rsquo;t keep them in the house!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
      Clyde. &ldquo;They would be certain to catch it from Charley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means certain. Even if they did, that would not be the worst
      thing that could happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? What would, then?&rdquo; challenged Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they should go out of this house, possibly carrying the poison
      with them into some other and defenseless community.&rdquo; Dr. Strong
      spoke a little sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither woman replied for a moment. When Mrs. Clyde spoke, it was with a
      changed voice. &ldquo;Yes. You are right. I didn&rsquo;t think. At least I
      thought only of my own children. It&rsquo;s hard to learn to think like a
      mother of all children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as near to the divine as any human can come,&rdquo;
      returned the Health Master gently. &ldquo;However, I think I can promise
      you that, if the twins and Bettykin haven&rsquo;t been touched with the
      poison already, they shan&rsquo;t get it from Charley. We&rsquo;ll
      organize a defense&mdash;provided only the enemy hasn&rsquo;t established
      itself already. Now the question is, where did the poison come from? We&rsquo;ll
      have Junkum in and see if she can help us find out.&rdquo; Julia, the more
      efficient of the eleven-year-old twins, a shrewd and observing youngster,
      resembling, in many respects, her grandmother, came at the doctor&rsquo;s
      summons and was told what had befallen Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Junkum. Then, &ldquo;Can I nurse him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not!&rdquo; burst out her mother and grandmother in
      a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later on you can help,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;In fact, I
      shall probably need your help. Now, Junkum, you remember I told you
      children a month ago that there was scarlet fever about and warned you to
      guard your mouths and noses with special care. Can you recall whether
      Charley has been careless?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Julia took the matter under consideration. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all
      been, I guess,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Clara Wingate gave a party last
      week and there was bobbing for apples, and everybody had their faces in
      the same tub of water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and Irving Wingate has since come down with scarlet fever,&rdquo;
      added Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough said!&rdquo; asserted the Health Master. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      think of any better way to disseminate germs than an apple-bobbing
      contest. It beats even kissing games. Well, the mischief is done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll all have it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s hope not. Nothing is more mysterious than the way
      contagion hits one and misses others. I should say there was at least an
      even chance of the rest escaping. But we must regard them as suspects, and
      report the house for quarantine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; shuddered Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;I hate that word. And
      think of my husband coming home to find a flaming red placard on the
      house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him warning before he leaves the factory. And now
      for our campaign. Item 1: a trained nurse. Item 2: a gas-range.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trained nurse, certainly,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;But
      why the gas-range? Isn&rsquo;t Charley&rsquo;s room warm enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. The stove isn&rsquo;t for warmth; it&rsquo;s for safety. I&rsquo;m
      going to establish a line of fire beyond which no contagion can pass. We&rsquo;ll
      put the stove in the hall, and keep on it a tin boiler full of water just
      at the simmering point. Everything which Charley has used or touched must
      go into that or other boiling water as soon as it leaves the room: the
      plates he eats from, the utensils he uses; his handkerchiefs,
      night-clothes, towels&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be a hard regimen to keep up,&rdquo; Mrs. Clyde objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martial law,&rdquo; said the Health Master positively. &ldquo;From
      the moment the red placard goes up, we&rsquo;re in a state of siege, and I&rsquo;m
      in command. The rules of the camp will be simple but strict. Whoever
      violates any of them will be liable to imprisonment in the strictest
      quarantine. We&rsquo;ll have a household conference to-night and go over
      the whole matter. Now I&rsquo;m going to telephone the Health Department
      and ask Dr. Merritt to come up and quarantine us officially.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of Charley?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      not going to keep me away from my boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when you put it in that way and use that tone,&rdquo; smiled
      Dr. Strong. &ldquo;I probably couldn&rsquo;t if I tried. Under official
      quarantine rules you&rsquo;ll have to give up going anywhere outside the
      house. Under our local martial law you&rsquo;re not to touch Charley or
      anything that he handles, nor to kiss the other children. And you&rsquo;re
      to wash your hands every time you come out of the sick-room, though it&rsquo;s
      only to step beyond the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an order,&rdquo; said the mother gravely. &ldquo;Will he be
      very ill, do you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far the cases have been mild. His is likely to be, too. But it&rsquo;s
      the most difficult kind of case to handle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, when he becomes convalescent. Then is when my troubles
      will begin. For the present the bulk of the work inside the sick-room will
      be upon the trained nurse and Mrs. Clyde. I&rsquo;ll have my troubles
      outside, watching the rest of the family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not since Dr. Strong came to the Clydes&rsquo; as guardian of their health
      had there been an emergency meeting called of the Household Protective
      Association, as the Health Master termed the organization which he had
      formed (mainly for educative purposes) within the family. That evening he
      addressed a full session, including the servants, holding up before them
      the red placard which the Health Department had sent, and informing them
      of the quarantine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No school?&rdquo; inquired the practical-minded Bobs, &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No school for you children, until further notice,&rdquo; confirmed
      the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no business for me, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. You can come and go as you please, so long as you keep
      away from Charley&rsquo;s room. Every one is barred from Charley&rsquo;s
      room until further instructions, except Mrs. Clyde; and she is confined
      within military bounds, consisting of the house and yard. And now for the
      most important thing&mdash;Rosie and Katie,&rdquo;&mdash;the cook and the
      maid&mdash;&ldquo;pay particular heed to this&mdash;nothing of any kind
      which comes from the sick-room is to be touched until it is disinfected,
      except under my supervision. When I&rsquo;m not in the house, the nurse&rsquo;s
      authority will be absolute. Now for the clinic; we&rsquo;ll look over the
      throats of the whole crowd.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Throat inspection appeared to be the Health Master&rsquo;s favorite
      pursuit for the next few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare open my mouth,&rdquo; protested Bobs, &ldquo;for
      fear he&rsquo;ll peek into it and find a spot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Strong spends a lot more time watching us than he does watching
      Charley,&rdquo; remarked Junkum. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the sick one, anyway&mdash;us
      or him?&rdquo; she concluded, her resentment getting the better of her
      grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; jeered Bobs, and intoned the ancient couplet, made and
      provided for the correction of such slips:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Her ain&rsquo;t a-callin&rsquo; we,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Us don&rsquo;t belong to she.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, I ain&rsquo;t sick,&rdquo; asseverated Bettina; &ldquo;but
      he shut me up in my room for a day jus&rsquo; because my swallow worked
      kinda hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to have scarlet fever I want to have scarlet
      fever and get done with it!&rdquo; declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired of staying out of school. Charley&rsquo;s
      having all the fun there is out of this, getting read to all the time by
      that nurse and Mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime nothing of interest was happening in the sick-room. Interesting
      phases seldom appear in scarlet fever, which is well, since, when they do
      appear, the patient usually dies. Not at any time did Charley evince the
      slightest tendency to forsake a world which he had found, on the whole, to
      be a highly satisfactory place of residence. In fact, he was going
      comfortably along through a typically light onset of the disease; and was
      rather less ill than he would have been with a sound case of measles.
      Already the furrows in Mrs. Clyde&rsquo;s forehead had smoothed out, and
      Grandma Sharpless had ceased waking, in the dead of night, with a catch at
      her heart and the totally unfounded fear that she had &ldquo;heard
      something,&rdquo; when one morning Charley awoke, scratched a tiny flake
      of skin off his nose, yawned, and emitted a hollow groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Charley boy?&rdquo; asked his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of staying in bed,&rdquo; announced the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The patient sat up, the better to consider the matter. &ldquo;I feel,&rdquo;
      he stated in positive accents, &ldquo;like a bucket of oyster stew, a
      steak as big as my head, with onions all over it, a whole apple pie, a
      platter of ice-cream, and a game of baseball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clyde laughed happily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the Health Master,&rdquo;
      she said. She did, and Dr. Strong came up and looked the patient over
      carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie back there, young fellow,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and
      play sick, no matter how well you feel, until I tell you different.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about that beefsteak and pie, Doctor?&rdquo; inquired the boy
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere prospects,&rdquo; retorted the hard-hearted physician. &ldquo;But
      you can have some ice-cream.&rdquo; Conclave of the elders that evening to
      consider the situation was opened by Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve now reached the critical point,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Critical?&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Clyde, whose nerves had been
      considerably stretched in the ten days of sick-room work. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
      he getting well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting well quite as quickly as I want him to. Perhaps
      a little more quickly. The fever is broken and he is beginning to peel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the difficulty?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this. Charley is a sturdy boy. The light attack he&rsquo;s had
      hasn&rsquo;t begun to exhaust his vitality. From now on, he is going to be
      a bundle of energy, without outlet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From now on till when?&rdquo; It was Grandma Sharpless who wanted
      to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two weeks anyway. Perhaps more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to keep that poor child in bed for two weeks after he&rsquo;s
      practically well?&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three weeks if the whole family will help me. It&rsquo;s not
      going to be easy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a little extreme, Strong?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the precaution of experience. The danger-point in scarlet
      fever isn&rsquo;t the illness; it&rsquo;s the convalescence. People think
      that when a child is cured of a disease, he is cured of the effects of the
      disease also. That mistake costs lives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the poison is still in the system?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather, the effects of the poison. Though the patient may feel
      quite well, the whole machinery of the body is out of gear. What do you do
      when your machinery goes wrong, Clyde?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; repeated the Health Master. &ldquo;Obviously we
      can&rsquo;t stop the machinery of life, but we can ease it down to its
      lowest possible strain, until it has had a chance to readjust itself. That
      is what I want to do in Charley&rsquo;s case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does this poison affect the system?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could discover that, I&rsquo;d be sure of a place in history.
      All we know is that no organ seems to be exempt from its sudden return
      attack long after the disease has passed. If we ever get any complete
      records, I venture to say that we&rsquo;ll find more children dying in
      after years from the results of scarlet fever than die from the immediate
      disease itself, not to mention such after-effects as deafness and
      blindness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless, &ldquo;when
      we lived in the country. And I remember a verse on the scarlet-fever page
      of an old almanac:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      If they run from nose or ear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Watch your children for a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But I always set down those cases to catching cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most people do. It isn&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s overstrain put on a
      poisoned system. And it&rsquo;s true not of scarlet fever alone, but of
      measles, and diphtheria, and grippe; and, in a lesser degree, of
      whooping-cough and chicken pox.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen such cases in your own practice?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Clyde, and regretted the question as soon as he had put it, for there
      passed over Dr. Strong&rsquo;s face the quick spasm of pain which anything
      referring back to the hidden past before he had come to the Clyde house
      always brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied with an effort. &ldquo;I have had such
      cases, and lost them. I might even say, killed them in my ignorance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Dr. Strong!&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde in quick sympathy.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Being mistaken isn&rsquo;t killing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, sometimes, for a doctor. I remember one little patient who
      had a very light case of scarlet fever. I let her get up as soon as the
      fever broke. Three months later she developed a dropsical tendency. And
      one day she fell dead across the doll she was playing with. The official
      cause of death said heart disease. But I knew what it was. The next case
      was not so wholly my fault. The boy was a spoiled child, who held his
      parents in enslavement. They hadn&rsquo;t the strength of character to
      keep him under control. He insisted on riding his bicycle around the yard,
      three days after he was out of bed. Against his willfulness my protests
      were of no account. What I should have done is to have thrown up the case;
      but I was young and the people were my friends. Well; that boy made,
      apparently, a complete recovery. A few weeks later I was sent for again.
      There was some kidney trouble. I knew, before the analysis was made, what
      it would show: nephritis. The poison had struck to the kidneys like a
      dagger. The poor little chap dragged along for some months before he died;
      and his mother&mdash;God forgive me if I did wrong in telling her the
      truth, as I did for the protection of their other child&mdash;almost lost
      her reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such cases are common?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Common enough to be fairly typical. Afterward, I cited the two
      instances in a talk before our medical society. My frankness encouraged
      some of the other men to be frank; and the list of fatalities and
      permanent disabilities, following scarlet fever and measles, which was
      brought out at that meeting, nearly every case being one of rushing the
      convalescence&mdash;well, it reformed one phase of medical procedure in&mdash;in
      that city and county.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it for Charley,&rdquo; decided Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;He
      stays in bed until you certify him cured, if I have to hire a vaudeville
      show to keep him amused.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy is not a spoiled child!&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde proudly.
      &ldquo;I can handle him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t before,&rdquo; remarked Grandma Sharpless
      dryly; &ldquo;but I think you&rsquo;ll have your hands full now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, &ldquo;I propose to enlist the
      services of the whole family, including the children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Let the others go to see Charley when he&rsquo;s peeling?&rdquo;
      protested Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all catch it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, from the skin-flakes. That&rsquo;s the way scarlet fever
      spreads.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said the Health Master mildly. &ldquo;Then perhaps
      you&rsquo;ll explain to me why doctors aren&rsquo;t the greatest danger
      that civilization suffers from.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they disinfect themselves,&rdquo; said the old lady, in a
      rather unconvinced tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how much that would amount to. The fine flakes of
      skin are likely to be pretty well disseminated in a sick-room. According
      to the old theory, every one of them is a potential disease-bearer. Now, a
      doctor could hardly be in a sickroom without getting some of them on his
      clothes or in his hair, as well as on his hands, which, of course, he
      thoroughly washes on leaving the place. But that&rsquo;s the extent of his
      disinfection. Why don&rsquo;t the flakes he carries with him spread the
      fever among his other patients?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask <i>me!</i>&rdquo; said Clyde. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      good at puzzles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many doctors still hold to the old theory. But I&rsquo;ve never met
      one who could answer that argument. Some of the best hospitals in the
      world discharge patients without reference to the peeling of the skin, and
      without evil results.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is scarlet fever caught, then?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the discharge from the inflamed nose and throat, or from the
      ears if they are affected. Anything which comes in contact with this
      poisonous mucus is dangerous. Thus, of course, the skin-flakes from the
      lips or the hands which had been in contact with the mouth or nose might
      carry the contagion, just as a fork or a tooth-brush or a handkerchief
      might. Now, I&rsquo;ll risk my status in this house on the safety of
      letting the other children visit Charley under certain restrictions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it for me,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, whose faith in his
      friend, while not unquestioning, was fundamental; and the two women
      agreed, though not without misgivings. Thereupon Bobs, Julia, and Bettina
      were sent for, and the Health Master announced that Charley would hold a
      reception on the following afternoon. There were shouts of acclamation at
      the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first,&rdquo; added Dr. Strong, &ldquo;there will be a
      rehearsal in the playroom, to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we need a rehearsal for to see Charley?&rdquo; inquired
      Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To guard yourselves, Miss Junkum,&rdquo; returned the doctor.
      &ldquo;Possibly you don&rsquo;t know everything about scarlet fever that
      you should know. Do you, Cherubic Miss Toots,&rdquo; he added, turning
      upon Bettina, &ldquo;know what a contagious disease is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the diminutive maiden gravely, &ldquo;that if
      you leave Charley&rsquo;s door open the jerrums will fly out and bite
      people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which fairly typifies the popular opinion concerning disease
      bacilli,&rdquo; observed Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a jerrum once,&rdquo; continued the infant of the family.
      &ldquo;It was under a stone in a creek. It had horns and a wiggly tail.
      Just like the Devil,&rdquo; she added with an engaging smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s been looking at the pictures in the comic
      supplements,&rdquo; explained her elder sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Popular education by the press!&rdquo; commented Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t time for an exposition of the germ theory
      now. The point is this: Can you children stay an hour in Charley&rsquo;s
      room without putting a lot of things in your mouths?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I never put anything in my mouth. You taught us better than
      that,&rdquo; said Julia reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was little impressed by the reproach. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he
      grunted. &ldquo;Well, suppose you stop nibbling at your hair&rdquo;&mdash;Julia&rsquo;s
      braid flew back over her shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;and consider that, when you
      put your fingers in your mouth, you may be putting in, also, a particle of
      everything that your fingers have touched. And in Charley&rsquo;s room
      there might be jerrums, as Twinkles calls them, from his mouth which would
      be dangerous. Rehearsal at noon tomorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Expectant curiosity brought the children early to the playroom whither
      they found that the Health Master had preceded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&rsquo;s it going to begin?&rdquo; asked Bettina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; replied the master of ceremonies. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      going to pretend that this is Charley&rsquo;s room. Just at present I&rsquo;m
      busy with some work.&rdquo; He shook a notebook at them. &ldquo;Go ahead
      and amuse yourselves till I get through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia the observant noted three hues of crayon on the stand beside the
      doctor. &ldquo;Are you going to make a sketch?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind. You attend to your affairs and I&rsquo;ll attend to
      mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Strong is a-goin&rsquo; to make a picture of a jerrum,&rdquo;
      Bettina informed her favorite doll, Susan Nipper, imprinting a fervent
      kiss on the pet&rsquo;s flattened face. &ldquo;Come on an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s
      read the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong made a note in his book, with a pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to play catch, Junkum?&rdquo; suggested Bobs to his twin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Julia, seizing upon a glove, while Bobs, in
      his rôle of pitcher, professionally moistened the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong made another note.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour they disported themselves in various ways while the
      Health Master, whose eyes were roving everywhere, made frequent entries in
      his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All out now,&rdquo; he ordered finally. &ldquo;Come back in five
      minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the time was up, they were clustered at the door. Dr. Strong
      admitted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the rehearsal begin now?&rdquo; asked Bobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; said the physician. &ldquo;Look around
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow-w-w!&rdquo; wailed Bettina. &ldquo;Look at Susan Nipper&rsquo;s
      nose!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That once inconspicuous feature had turned a vivid green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the baseball is red,&rdquo; cried Bobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&rsquo;s my glove,&rdquo; announced Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking over to her, the Health Master caught her left hand and smeared it
      with blue crayon. For good measure he put a dab on her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My story-book is all blue, too,&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      it for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just by way of illustration,&rdquo; explained the doctor. &ldquo;The
      mouths of all of us contain germs of one kind or another. So I&rsquo;ve
      assumed that Bob&rsquo;s mouth has red, and Junkum&rsquo;s blue, and Miss
      Twinkle&rsquo;s green. Every chalk mark shows where you&rsquo;ve spread
      your germs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the red on the ball is where I wet my fingers for that
      in-curve,&rdquo; said Bobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on my glove is where I caught it,&rdquo; said Julia. &ldquo;But
      what&rsquo;s the blue doing on my left hand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; announced Bobs triumphantly. &ldquo;You got that
      slow drop on the end of your finger and jammed your finger in your mouth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hurt,&rdquo; defended Julia. &ldquo;Look at the walls&mdash;and
      the Indian clubs&mdash;and the chair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crayon marks were everywhere. In some places it was one color; in others
      another; in many, a crazy pattern of red, blue, and green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I carried it out,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;your faces
      would all be as bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; murmured Betty to Susan Nipper; &ldquo;I
      <i>will</i> kiss you even if you do turn green.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t kiss Charley,&rdquo; interposed Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve had enough rehearsal, we&rsquo;ll go and make our
      call right after luncheon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the sick-room, the three visitors stood a little abashed and
      strange. Their hearty, rough-and-tumble brother looked strangely drawn and
      brighteyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, kids!&rdquo; said he, airily. &ldquo;Make yourselves at
      home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bettykin was the first to break the ice. &ldquo;Did it hurt, Charley?&rdquo;
      she asked, remembering her own experience with adenoids.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; said the convalescent. &ldquo;Only thing that hurts is
      being kept in bed when I want to be up and around. What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Much was new, there in the room, and the children took it in, wide-eyed.
      Although it was early May, the windows were screened. All the hangings and
      curtains had been taken out of the room, which looked bare and bright. On
      the door of the bathroom was a huge roller-towel of soft, cloth-like
      paper, perforated in lengths so as to be easily detachable, and below it a
      scrap-basket, with a sign: &ldquo;Throw Paper Towels in Here to be Burned

      PENALTIES
    </h3>
    <p>
      For First Violation of Rules&mdash;Offender Reads to Patient One Hour.
      Second Violation&mdash;Banishment for Balance of Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dead-line is that thing, I suppose,&rdquo; said Junkum,
      pointing to a tape stretched upon standards around the bed at a distance
      of a yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a game?&rdquo; questioned the hopeful Bettina. &ldquo;No,
      Bettykin. It&rsquo;s a germ-cage. No germs can get out of that unless they&rsquo;re
      carried out by somebody or something. And, in that case, they&rsquo;re
      boiled to death on the gas-stove outside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Charley called for a drink of water. After he had emptied
      the glass, his mother took it out and dropped it into the disinfecting hot
      bath. Then she washed her hands, dried them on a strip of the paper towel
      and dropped that in the basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Julia, the observant. &ldquo;Nothing gets any
      scarlet fever on it except what Charley touches. And everything he touches
      has to be washed as soon as it comes out of the dead-line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. We&rsquo;ll make a trained nurse of you, yet, Junkum,&rdquo;
      approved the Health Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Julia slowly, &ldquo;I think Bobs ought to wash
      his hands now. Mother opened the door after handling Charley&rsquo;s
      glass, and when he went to watch her wash the glass, he put his hand on
      the knob.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One mark against Bobs,&rdquo; announced the doctor. &ldquo;The
      rigor of the game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A game it proved to be, with Charley for umpire, and a very keen umpire,
      as he was the beneficiary of the penalties. For some days Charley quite
      fattened on literature dispensed orally by the incautious. Presently,
      however, they became so wary that it was hard to catch them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, indeed, was the doctor hard put to it to keep the invalid amused.
      The children invented games and charades for him. A special telephone wire
      was run to his room so that he might talk with his friends. Bobs won
      commendations by flying a kite one windy day and passing the twine up
      through Charley&rsquo;s window, whereby the bedridden one spent a happy
      afternoon &ldquo;feeling her pull.&rdquo; And the next day Betty won the
      first and only dollar by discovering a small and early fly which,
      presumably, had crawled in by the hole bored for the kite twine. As to any
      encroachments upon the physical quiet of his patient or the protective
      guardianship surrounding him, the Health Master was adamant, until, on a
      day, after examining the prisoner&rsquo;s throat and nose, and going over
      him, as Mr. Clyde put it, &ldquo;like a man buying a horse that&rsquo;s
      cheaper than he ought to be,&rdquo; he sent for the Health Officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clean throat,&rdquo; said Dr. Merritt. &ldquo;Never
      mind the desquamating skin. We&rsquo;ll call it off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Charley was raised from his bed, and having symbolically broken
      the tape-line about his bed, headed a solemn and slow procession of the
      entire family to the front porch where he formally took down the red
      placard and tore it in two. The halves still ornament the playroom, as a
      memento.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this memorable ceremony, Mrs. Clyde retired to the library and,
      quite contrary to her usually self-restrained nature, dissolved into
      illogical tears, in which condition she was found by the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo;
      she sobbed, in response to her husband&rsquo;s inquiry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      just because I hated the very thought of that abominable red sign so,&mdash;as
      if we were unclean&mdash;like lepers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not lepers and if we can continue in that blessed
      state,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Strong cheerfully, &ldquo;we can escape most of
      the ills that flesh is heir to. After all, from a scientific point of
      view, contagion is merely the Latin synonym for a much shorter and uglier
      word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is&mdash;&rdquo; queried Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirt,&rdquo; said the Health Master.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;H</span>opeless
      from the first,&rdquo; said old Mrs. Sharpless, with a sigh, to her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clyde nodded. &ldquo;I suppose so. And she has so much to live for,
      too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this that&rsquo;s hopeless from the first?&rdquo;
      asked the Health Master, looking up from the novel which he was enjoying
      in what he called his &ldquo;lazy hour,&rdquo; after luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Westerly&rsquo;s case,&rdquo; said the younger woman. &ldquo;Even
      now that she&rsquo;s gone to the hospital, the family won&rsquo;t admit
      that it&rsquo;s cancer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, of the liver, I suppose,&rdquo; commented the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth should you suppose that?&rdquo; demanded Mrs.
      Sharpless suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because cancer of the liver is the only form which could
      possibly be regarded as hopeless from the first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All cancer, if it is really cancer, is hopeless,&rdquo; declared
      the old lady with vigorous dogmatism. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me. I&rsquo;ve
      seen too many cases die and too few get well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were those &lsquo;few&rsquo; hopeless, too?&rdquo; inquired Dr.
      Strong with bland slyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they weren&rsquo;t cancer, at all,&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
      Sharpless; &ldquo;just doctors&rsquo; mistakes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctors do make mistakes,&rdquo; admitted the representative of the
      profession, &ldquo;and cancer is one of the diseases where they are most
      commonly at fault. But the error isn&rsquo;t of the kind that you suggest,
      Grandma Sharpless. Where they go wrong so often is in mistaking cancer for
      some less malignant trouble; not in mistaking the less malignant forms for
      cancer. And that wastes thousands of lives every year which might have
      been saved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could they have been saved?&rdquo; asked the old lady
      combatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me do the questioning for a minute, and perhaps we&rsquo;ll get
      at that. Now, these many cases that you&rsquo;ve known: were most of the
      fatal ones recent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; she replied, after some consideration. &ldquo;No;
      most of them were from ten years ago, back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Now, the few that recovered: when did these occur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within a few years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of the old cases recovered?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a fair proportion of the more recent ones have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these were operated on, weren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I believe they were. But not all that were operated on lived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did a single one of those not operated on live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so far as I can remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there we have the truth about cancer in a few words; or,
      anyway, a good part of the truth. Up to twenty years ago or so, cancer was
      practically incurable. It always returned after operation. That was
      because the surgeon thought he needed only to cut out the cancer. Now he
      knows better; he knows that he must cut out all the tissue and the glands
      around the obvious cancer, and thus get the root of the growth out of the
      system.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that cures?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a great majority of cases, <i>if it is done early enough</i>.&rdquo;
      The Health Master dropped his book and beat time with an emphatic
      forefinger to his concluding words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Agnes Westerly&rsquo;s is cancer of the breast,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Clyde, as if that clinched the case against the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about the most favorable locality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was the worst.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where on earth do intelligent women collect their superstitions
      about cancer?&rdquo; cried Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Carcinoma of the breast is
      the commonest form among women, and the easiest to handle. Show me a case
      in the first stages and, with a good surgical hospital at hand, I&rsquo;d
      almost guarantee recovery. It&rsquo;s simply a question of removing the
      entire breast, and sometimes the adjacent glands. Ninety per cent of the
      early cases should get well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the operation itself is so terrible,&rdquo; shuddered Mrs.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible? Unpleasant, I&rsquo;ll admit. But if you mean terrible in
      the sense of dangerous, or even serious, you&rsquo;re far wrong again. The
      percentage of mortality from the operation itself is negligible. But the
      percentage of mortality without operation is 100 out of 100. So the choice
      is an easy one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to hold out little hope for Agnes Westerly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear about the circumstances,&rdquo; suggested Dr.
      Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two years ago&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad beginning,&rdquo; interrupted the physician,
      shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;She noticed a small lump in her right breast. It didn&rsquo;t
      trouble her much&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seldom does at the start.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And she didn&rsquo;t want to alarm her husband; so she said
      nothing about it. It kept getting a little larger very slowly, but there
      was no outside sore; so she thought it couldn&rsquo;t be serious. If it
      were, she thought, it would pain her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fatal mistake! Pain is a late symptom in cancer&mdash;usually
      too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was curious the way she finally came to find out. She read an
      advertisement in the paper, headed, &lsquo;Any Lump in Woman&rsquo;s
      Breast is Cancer.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know that advertisement. It&rsquo;s put out by a scoundrel
      named Chamlee. Surely, she didn&rsquo;t try his torturing treatment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Agnes is too intelligent for that. But it frightened her
      into going to her doctor. He told her that a radical operation was her
      only chance. She was terribly frightened,&mdash;more afraid of the knife
      than of the disease, she told me,&mdash;and she insisted on delay until
      the pain grew intolerable. And now, they say, there&rsquo;s only a slight
      chance. Isn&rsquo;t it pitiful?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pitiful, and typical. Mrs. Westerly, if she dies, is a type of
      suicide, the suicide of fear and ignorance. Two years&rsquo; waiting! And
      every day subtracting from her chance. That&rsquo;s the curse of cancer;
      that people won&rsquo;t understand the vital necessity of promptness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it true that any lump in a woman&rsquo;s breast is cancer?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s a lie; a damnable lie, circulated by that quack to
      scare foolish women into his toils. Most of such lumps are non-malignant
      growths. This is true, though: that any lump in a woman&rsquo;s breast is
      suspicious. It may be cancer; or it may develop into cancer. The only
      course is to find out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;With the knife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather a severe method for a symptom that may not
      mean anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too severe, considering the danger. Whatever the lump may be,
      it has no business there in the breast, any more than a bullet has. If it
      is only a small benign tumor, the process of taking it out is very simple,
      and there is nothing further to do. While the patient is still under the
      anaesthetic, a microscopical examination of the tissue, which can be made
      in a few minutes in a well-equipped hospital, will determine whether the
      growth is malignant. If so, the whole breast is taken off, and the
      patient, in all probability, saved. If not, sew up the wound, and the
      subject is none the worse. Much the better, in fact, for the most innocent
      growth may develop cancer by irritation. Thirty per cent, or more, of
      breast cancers develop in this way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But irritation alone won&rsquo;t cause cancer, will it?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Clyde, her restlessly inquiring mind reaching back, as was
      typical of her mental processes, toward first causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There must be something else. What that something is, we don&rsquo;t
      know. But we are pretty certain that it doesn&rsquo;t develop unless there
      is irritation of some kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t cancer a germ disease?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows. Some day we may&mdash;probably shall&mdash;find out.
      Meantime we have the knowledge of how to prevent it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How to prevent a disease you don&rsquo;t know the nature of?&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Sharpless incredulously. &ldquo;That sounds like nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it? What about smallpox? We haven&rsquo;t any idea of what
      smallpox really is; but we are able to control it with practical certainty
      through vaccination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctors don&rsquo;t vaccinate for cancer,&rdquo; remarked the
      practical-minded old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have tried serums, but that is no use. As I said, the
      immediate occasion of cancer is irritation. There is overwhelming proof
      that an unhealing sore or irritation at any point is likely to result in
      the development of a cancer at that point, and at least a highly probable
      inference that, without such irritation, the disease would not develop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not get rid of the irritation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s the point. That&rsquo;s where the tremendous
      life-saving could be effected. Take a very simple instance, cancer of the
      lip. In a thousand cases recorded by one of the Johns Hopkins experts,
      there wasn&rsquo;t one but had developed from a small sore, at first of
      innocent nature. It isn&rsquo;t too much to say that this particular
      manifestation of cancer is absolutely preventable. If every person with a
      sore on the lip which doesn&rsquo;t heal within three weeks were to go to
      a good surgeon, this hideous and defacing form of tumor would disappear
      from the earth. As for carcinoma of the tongue, one of the least hopeful
      of all varieties, no careful person need ever develop it. Good dentistry,
      which keeps the mouth free of jagged tooth-edges, is half the battle. The
      other half is caution on the part of smokers. If a white patch develops in
      the mouth, tobacco should be given up at once. Unless the patch heals
      within a few weeks, the patient should consult a physician, and, if
      necessary, have it removed by a minor operation. That&rsquo;s all there is
      to that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the irritant sore is internal?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the watchful it will give evidence of its presence, usually in
      time. If it is in the intestines or stomach, there is generally some
      uneasiness, vague, perhaps, but still suspicious, to announce the danger.
      Surgical records covering a long period show that eighty per cent of
      stomach cancers were preceded by definite gastric symptoms of more than a
      year&rsquo;s duration. If it is in the uterus, there are definite signs
      which every woman ought to be taught to understand. And here, to go back
      to the matter of cure, even if the discovery isn&rsquo;t made until cancer
      has actually developed, there is an excellent chance in the early stages.
      Cancer of the stomach used to be sure doom to a hideous death. Now, taking
      the cases as they come, the desperate chances with the early cases, more
      than a quarter are saved in the best surgical hospitals. Where the growth
      is in the womb or the intestines, with reasonably early discovery, a
      generous half should be repaired and returned to active life as good as
      new.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem possible,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless
      flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply because you&rsquo;ve been steeped in the fatalism which
      surrounds cancer. That fatalism, which is so hard to combat, is what keeps
      women from the saving hope of the knife. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to die
      anyway,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m not going to be carved up before I
      die.&rsquo; And so they throw away what chance they have. Oh, if only I
      had control of the newspapers of this city for one day a week or a month,&mdash;just
      for a half-column editorial,&mdash;what a saving of life I could effect! A
      little simple advice in straight-out terms would teach the people of this
      community to avoid poor Mrs. Westerly&rsquo;s fate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And drive &lsquo;em all into the hands of the doctors,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Sharpless shrewdly. &ldquo;A fine fattening of fees for your trade,
      young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? Do you think that cancer <i>ever</i> fails to come
      to the physician at last? And do you think the fee is less because the
      surgeon has to do twice the amount of work with a hundredth of the hope of
      success?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o-o,&rdquo; admitted the old lady, with some hesitancy; &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t think of it in that light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few do. Oh, for the chance to teach people to think straight about
      this! Publicity is what we need so bitterly, and the only publicity goes
      to the quacks who pay for it, because the local newspapers don&rsquo;t
      want to write about &lsquo;unpleasant topics,&rsquo; forsooth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want a chance for some publicity in a small way?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I! Show me the chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mothers&rsquo; Association meets here this afternoon. We haven&rsquo;t
      much business on hand. Come in and talk to us for an hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said the Health Master, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Half
      of that time will do me. How many will be there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About sixty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Just have me introduced with the statement that I&rsquo;m
      going to talk informally on a subject of importance to all of you; and
      then help me out with a little object lesson. I&rsquo;ll want sixty sealed
      envelopes for the members to draw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you conducting a lottery, young man?&rdquo; queried Grandma
      Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way. Rather I&rsquo;m arranging an illustration for the great
      lottery which Life and Death conduct.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, the business of the meeting having been concluded, Mrs.
      Clyde asked, from the assembled mothers, the privilege of the floor for
      Dr. Strong, and this being granted, aroused the curiosity of the meeting
      by requesting each member to draw an envelope from the basket which she
      carried around, while the presiding officer introduced the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me begin,&rdquo; said the Health Master, &ldquo;with an
      ungallant assumption. I&rsquo;m going to assume that I&rsquo;m talking to
      a gathering of middle-aged women. That being the case, I&rsquo;m going on
      to a very unpleasant statement, to wit, that one out of every eight women
      here may reasonably expect to die of cancer in some form.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little subdued flutter passed through the room, and the name of Agnes
      Westerly was whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is Mrs. Westerly&rsquo;s case which is responsible for my
      being here,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, who had abnormally keen hearing.
      &ldquo;I would like to save at least part of the eight out of your number,
      who are statistically doomed, from this probable fate. To bring the lesson
      home to you, I have had each of you draw an envelope. Eight of these
      represent death by cancer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye in the room turned, with rather ghastly surmise, to the little
      white squares. But old Mrs. Sharpless rose from her place, marched upon
      the Health Master, as one who leads a charge, and in low but vehement
      tones protested: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be a party to any such nonsense. The
      idea! Scaring some woman that&rsquo;s as well as you are into nervous
      collapse with your black dot or red cross or whatever you&rsquo;ve got
      inside these envelopes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Grandma Sharpless, Grandma Sharpless! Have you known me all
      this time not to trust me further than that?&rdquo; whispered the Health
      Master. &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little woman near the rear of the room spoke up with a fine bravado:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. It can&rsquo;t give me cancer.&rdquo; Then a
      pause, and a sigh of relief, which brought out a ripple of nervous
      laughter from the rest, as she said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor in mine,&rdquo; added a young and pretty woman, in the second
      row, who had furtively and swiftly employed a hatpin to satisfy her
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor mine!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nor mine!&rdquo; added a dozen
      voices, in varying tones of alleviated suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in any of them,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, smiling. &ldquo;My
      little design was to arouse you collectively to a sense of the danger, not
      to frighten you individually into hysterics.&rdquo; (At this point Mrs.
      Sharpless sat down abruptly and fanned a resentful face.) &ldquo;The ugly
      fact remains, however: one out of every eight here is marked for death by
      the most dreadful of diseases, unless you do something about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; inquired the minister&rsquo;s wife, in the
      pause that followed this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Educate yourselves. If, in the process, you educate others, so much
      the better. Now I propose to tell you all about cancer in half an hour.
      Does that sound like a large contract? When I say &lsquo;all,&rsquo; I
      mean all that it is necessary for you to know in order to protect
      yourselves. And, for good measure, I&rsquo;ll answer any questions&mdash;if
      I can&mdash;within the limit of time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> cancer?&rdquo; asked a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! There is one that I can&rsquo;t answer. No one knows. If I told
      you that it was a malignant tumor, that would be true, but it wouldn&rsquo;t
      be an answer, because we don&rsquo;t know the real nature and underlying
      cause of the tumor. Whether it is caused by a germ, science has not yet
      determined. But though we know nothing of the fundamental cause of the
      disease, we do understand, definitely, what is the immediate causative
      influence. It practically always arises from some local sore or
      irritation. Therefore&mdash;and here is my first important point&mdash;it
      is preventable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be only theoretically, wouldn&rsquo;t it, Dr. Strong?&rdquo;
      asked the little woman who had first braved the venture of the sealed
      envelope. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t get through life without bumps and
      scratches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. But ordinary bumps or scratches properly looked after don&rsquo;t
      cause cancer. The sore must be an unhealing one, or the irritation a
      continued condition, in order to be dangerous. Remember this: any sort of
      a sore, inflammation, or scarification, external or internal, which
      continues more than a few weeks, is an invitation to cancer. Therefore,
      get rid of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the injury is in the stomach, where it can&rsquo;t be
      got at?&rdquo; asked a member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t it be got at?&rdquo; demanded Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it be got at?&rdquo; retorted the questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By opening up the stomach and examining it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want anybody to open up my stomach just to see
      what is inside it!&rdquo; declared Mrs. Sharpless vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely not. Perhaps you&rsquo;d feel different if you&rsquo;d
      had steady pain or indigestion for two or three years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that mean cancer?&rdquo; asked a tall, sallow woman anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by any means necessarily. But it may well mean gastric ulcer,
      and that may develop into cancer. Three fourths of the cases of carcinoma
      of the stomach which come into the surgeon&rsquo;s hands have developed
      from gastric ulcer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no cure but the knife?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the cancer. For the gastric ulcer, yes. Careful medical
      care and diet often cure it. The trouble is that patients insist on diet
      and drugs in cases where they have proved themselves ineffectual. Those
      cases should come to the surgeon. But it will take long to educate the
      public to the significance of long-continued abdominal pain or
      indigestion. The knife is the last thing they are willing to think of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But stomach operations are terribly dangerous, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
      inquired a member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any more. They were once. The operation for gastric ulcer in
      the early stage is simple. Even developed cancer of the stomach can be
      cured by the knife in from twenty-five to thirty per cent of the cases.
      Without the knife, it is sure death. I&rsquo;m glad we got to the stomach
      first, because that is the most obscure and least hopeful of the common
      locations of the growth. In carcinoma of the breast, the most prevalent
      form among women, there is one simple, inclusive rule of prevention and
      cure. Any lump in the breast should be regarded, as Blood-good of Johns
      Hopkins puts it, &lsquo;as an acute disease.&rsquo; It should come out
      immediately. If such growths come at once to the surgeon, prevention and
      cure together would save probably ninety per cent of those who now die
      from this &lsquo;creeping death,&rsquo; as our parents called it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll ask you to imagine for the moment that I am
      conducting a clinic, for I&rsquo;m not going to mince words in speaking of
      cancer of the womb, the next commonest form. Any persistent irritation
      there is a peril. If there is a slight, steady, and untimely discharge,
      that&rsquo;s a danger signal. The woman should at once have a
      microscopical examination made. This is simple, almost painless, and
      practically a sure determination of whether there is cancer or not. The
      thing to do is to find out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it is cancer, is there any chance?&rdquo; asked the lady of
      the hatpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you regard tuberculosis as hopeless?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your parents would have. But you have profited by popular
      education. If the public understood what to do in cancer as thoroughly as
      they know about tuberculosis, we&rsquo;d save almost if not quite as many
      victims from the more terrible disease. Fatalism is as out of place in the
      one as in the other. The gist of the matter is taking the thing in time.
      Let me read you what the chairman of the Cancer Campaign Committee of the
      Congress of Surgeons of North America, Dr. Thomas S. Cullen, of Baltimore,
      says: &lsquo;Surgeons are heartsick to see the many cancer patients
      begging for operations when the disease is so far advanced that nothing
      can be done. Cancer is in the beginning a local process and not a blood
      disease, and in its early stages can be completely removed. When the
      cancer is small the surgeon can, with one fourth the amount of labor,
      accomplish ten times the amount of good.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that always mean the knife?&rdquo; asked a timid-looking
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always. There is no other hope, once the malignant growth has
      begun. But the knife is not so terrible. In fact, in the early stages it
      is not terrible at all. Modern surgery has reduced pain to a minimum. The
      strongest argument against dread is a visit to a well-equipped surgical
      hospital, where one can see patients sitting up in bed and enjoying life a
      few days after a major operation. Even at the worst, the knife is less
      terrible than death, its certain alternative.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you call it the certain alternative?&rdquo; asked the
      minister&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;I have seen facial cancer cured by
      concentrated ray treatment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t cancer; it was lupus,&rdquo; replied Dr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong; &ldquo;a wholly different thing. True cancer of the face in its
      commonest location, the lips, is the most frequently cured of any form,
      but only by operation. Now here&rsquo;s an interesting and suggestive
      point; taking lip-cancer patients as they come to us, we get perhaps
      sixty-five per cent of complete cures. With cancer of the womb, we get in
      all not more than forty per cent of recoveries. Perhaps some of you will
      be able to suggest the explanation for this contrast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because cancer of the lip isn&rsquo;t as deadly a disease,&rdquo;
      ventured some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cancer is cancer, wherever it is located. Unless it is removed it
      is always and equally deadly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is because the internal operation is so much more
      dangerous,&rdquo; offered another member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; uterine operations are easy and simple. It is simply because
      the sore on the face is obvious, plain, unmistakable evidence of something
      wrong; and the patient ordinarily gets into the surgeon&rsquo;s hands
      early; that is, before the roots of the growth have spread and involved
      life itself. The difference in mortality between carcinoma of the lip and
      carcinoma of the womb is the difference between early operation and
      delayed operation. If uterine cancer or breast cancer were discovered as
      early as lip cancer, we&rsquo;d save practically as many of the internal
      as we do of the external cases. And if all the lip cancer cases were
      noticed at the first development, we&rsquo;d save ninety-five per cent of
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the business of the physician to find out about the
      internal forms?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often the physician hasn&rsquo;t the chance. The woman ought to do
      the first diagnosing herself. That is, she must be taught to recognize
      suspicious symptoms. In Germany there has been a campaign of education
      among women on cancer of the womb. The result is that more than twice as
      many Germans come to the operating table, in time to give a fair chance of
      permanent recovery in this class of cases, as do Americans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the American woman, who knows nothing about such matters, to
      find out?&rdquo; queried the minister&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a campaign of education now under way here. Publications
      giving the basic facts about cancer, its prevention and cure, in simple
      and popular form, can be had from the American Society for the Control of
      Cancer,&mdash;Thomas M. Debevoise, secretary, 62 Cedar Street, New York
      City; or more detailed advice can be had from the Cancer Campaign
      Committee of the Congress of Surgeons of North America, Dr. Thomas S.
      Cullen, chairman, 3 West Preston Street, Baltimore; or from Dr. F. R.
      Green, 535 Dearborn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, secretary of the Council of
      Health and Public Instruction of the American Medical Association.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not more easily and readily one&rsquo;s own physician?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t go to their own physicians early enough. It is
      necessary that they be trained to understand symptoms which do not at
      first seem serious enough for medical attention. Besides, I regret to
      confess, in this matter of cancer our physicians need educating, too. They
      are too prone to say, if they are not sure of the diagnosis, &lsquo;Wait
      and see.&rsquo; Waiting to see is what kills three fourths of the women
      who succumb to cancer. Let me illustrate this peril by two cases which
      have come under my observation: The wife of a lawyer in a Western city had
      a severe attack of stomach trouble. Her doctor, a young and open-minded
      man, had the courage to say, T don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s
      cancer. You&rsquo;d better go to such-and-such a hospital and let them
      see.&rsquo; The woman went. An exploratory incision was made and carcinoma
      found in the early stage. It was cut out and to-day she is as good as new.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, this same lawyer had a friend who had been treated for months
      by a stomach specialist of some reputation. Under the treatment he had
      grown steadily thinner, paler, and weaker. &lsquo;Indigestion, gastric
      intoxication,&rsquo; the specialist repeated, parrotlike, until the man
      himself, in his misery, began to suspect. At this point the lawyer friend
      got hold of him and took him to the hospital where his wife had been. The
      surgeons refused the case and sent the man away to die. Indignant, the
      lawyer sought the superintendent of the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why won&rsquo;t you take my friend&rsquo;s case?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is inoperable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cancer of the stomach, like my wife&rsquo;s?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You cured my wife. Why can&rsquo;t you cure my friend?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The official shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want an answer,&rdquo; insisted the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, frankly,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;your wife&rsquo;s
      physician knew his business. Your friend&rsquo;s physician is a fool. He
      has killed his patient by delay.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back home went the lawyer, and spread that story quietly. To-day
      the specialist&rsquo;s practice is almost ruined; but he has learned an
      expensive lesson. The moral is this: If your doctor is doubtful whether
      your trouble is cancerous, and advises delay, get another doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, there is the &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; type of practitioner,
      who is timid about making a complete job of his operation. One of this
      kind had the case of an acquaintance of mine who was stricken with cancer
      of the breast. The physician, under persuasion of his patient, I presume,
      advised excising only the tumor itself, but the husband, who had been
      reading up on cancer, insisted on a radical operation. The entire breast
      was removed. A year later the woman&rsquo;s unmarried sister was afflicted
      in exactly the same way; but the discovery was made earlier, so that the
      case was a distinctly favorable one. The girl, however, would not consent
      to the radical operation, and the physician (the same man) declared it
      unnecessary. The tumor alone was cut out. The cancer reappeared and
      another operation was necessary. The girl died after cruel suffering. The
      married sister is alive, and, five years after the operation, as sound as
      a bell. That physician is a wiser man; also a sadder one. There&rsquo;s a
      special moral to this, too: the operator has but one chance; he must do
      his work thoroughly, or he might better not do it at all. When cancer
      returns after operation&mdash;which means that the roots were not
      eradicated&mdash;it is invariably fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are a few things which I want every one of you to remember.
      Had I had time I&rsquo;d have had them printed for each of you to take
      home, so important do I think them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No cancer is hopeless when discovered early.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most cancer, discovered early, is permanently curable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only cure is the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medicines are worse than useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delay is more than dangerous; it is deadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one hope, and a strong one, is prompt and radical operation. A
      half-operation is worse than none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most, if not all, cancer is preventable by correcting the minor
      difficulty from which it develops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With recognition of, and prompt action upon early symptoms, the
      death rate can be cut down at least a half; probably more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fatalism which says: &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s cancer, I might as
      well give up,&rsquo; is foolish, cowardly, and suicidal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, finally, here is some simple advice, intelligible to any
      thinking human being, which has been indorsed in printed form by the
      Congress of Surgeons of North America:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Be careful of persistent sores or irritations, external or
      internal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Be careful of yourself, without undue worry. At the first
      suspicious symptom go to some good physician and demand the truth. Don&rsquo;t
      wait for pain to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If the doctor suspects cancer insist that he confirm or
      disprove his suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a hopeless fatalist. If it&rsquo;s cancer
      face it bravely. With courage and prompt action the chances of recovery
      are all in your favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t defer an advised operation even for a day; and
      don&rsquo;t shrink from the merciful knife, when the alternative is the
      merciless anguish of slow death.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the woman who fears the knife, Dr. Charles H. Mayo, one of the
      greatest of living surgeons, has spoken the final words: &lsquo;The risk
      is not in surgery, but in <i>delayed surgery</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said my say, ladies, and there are five minutes left. Has
      any one any further questions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was none. But as he stepped down, Mrs. Sharpless whispered to him:
      &ldquo;I watched them while you talked, and half of those women are
      thinking, and thinking <i>hard</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months thereafter, Mrs. Clyde came into the Health Master&rsquo;s
      office one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from a sort of experience meeting of the
      Mothers&rsquo; Club,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the topic this time?&rdquo; asked Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aftermath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cancer talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything definite?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Definite, indeed! Between fifteen and twenty of the members went
      away from that meeting where you talked, suspecting themselves of cancer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too many.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Ten of them had their fears set at rest right away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have frightened them; but one has to do a little
      harm in aiming at almost any good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was worth it. Half a dozen others had minor operations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps saving major ones later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. And four of them actually had cancer. Three out of the
      four are going to be well women. The fourth has an even chance. Dr.
      Strong, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve done so good a day&rsquo;s work
      since you brought health into this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said the doctor simply; &ldquo;I think you are
      right. And you&rsquo;ve given me the most profound and about the rarest
      satisfaction with which the physician is ever rewarded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The practical certainty of having definitely saved human life,&rdquo;
      said the Health Master.

    <h2>
      IX.&mdash;THE GOOD GRAY DOCTOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> twenty-dollar
      bill! Crisp, fresh, and golden, it rose monumentally from the basis of
      nickels, dimes, and quarters which made up the customary collection of the
      Bairdstown Memorial Church. Even the generosity of the Clyde family, who,
      whenever they spent a week-end at Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s farm outside the
      little city, attended the Sunday services, looked meager and insignificant
      beside its yellow-backed splendor. Deacon Wilkes, passing the plate, gazed
      at it in fascination. Subsequent contributors surreptitiously touched it
      in depositing their own modest offerings, as if to make certain of its
      substance. It was even said at the Wednesday Sewing Circle that the Rev.
      Mr. Huddleston, from his eminence in the pulpit, had marked its colorful
      glint with an instant and benign eye and had changed the final hymn to one
      which specially celebrated the glory of giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Clyde pew also there was one who specially noted the donor, but
      with an expression far from benign. Dr. Strong&rsquo;s appraising glance
      ranged over the plump and glossy perfection of the stranger, his symphonic
      grayness, beginning at his gray-suède-shod feet, one of which
      unobtrusively protruded into the aisle, verging upward through gray sock
      and trouser to gray frock coat, generously cut, and terminating at the
      sleek gray head. Even the tall hat which the man dandled on his knees was
      gray. Against this Quakerish color-scheme the wearer&rsquo;s face stood
      out, large, pink, and heavy-jowled, lighted by restless brown eyes. His
      manner was at once important and reverent, and his &ldquo;amen&rdquo; a
      masterpiece of unction. No such impressive outlander had visited
      Bairdstown for many a moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the service the visitor went forward to speak with Mr. Huddleston.
      At the same time Dr. Strong strolled up the aisle and contrived to pass
      the two so, as to obtain a face-to-face view of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow, then, and I shall be delighted to
      see you,&rdquo; the pastor was saying as Dr. Strong passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Professor,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, with an accent on
      the final word as slight as the nod which accompanied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning! Good-morning!&rdquo; returned the other heartily. But
      his glance, as it followed the man who had accosted him, was puzzled and
      not wholly untroubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your munificent friend?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde, as the
      Health Master emerged from the church and joined her husband and herself
      in their car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I last ran across him he called himself Professor Graham Gray,
      the Great Gray Benefactor,&rdquo; replied Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dresses the part, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; observed Mr. Clyde.
      &ldquo;Where was it that you knew him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the Pacific Coast, five years ago. He was then &lsquo;itinerating&rsquo;&mdash;the
      quack term for traveling from place to place, picking up such practice as
      may be had by flamboyant advertising. Itinerating in eyes, as he would
      probably put it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wandering quack oculist?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Optician, rather, since he carried his own stock of glasses. In
      fact that&rsquo;s where his profit came in. He advertised treatment free
      and charged two or three dollars for the glasses, special rates to
      schoolchildren. The scheme is an old one and a devilish. Half of the
      children in San Luis Obispo County, where I chanced upon his trail, were
      wearing his vision-twisters by the time he was through with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of glasses were they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes magnifying lenses. Mostly just plain window glass. Few
      children escaped him, for he would tell the parents that only prompt
      action could avert blindness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least the plain glass couldn&rsquo;t hurt the children,&rdquo;
      suggested Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it! It couldn&rsquo;t fail to hurt them. Modify the
      sight of a delicate instrument like a child&rsquo;s eye continuously by
      the most transparent of barriers, and it is bound to go wrong soon. The
      magnifying glasses are far worse. There are hundreds of children in that
      one locality alone who will carry the stigma of his quackery throughout
      their lives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he is here with a view to practicing his amiable
      trade?&rdquo; inquired Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only in part, if at all. I understand that he has changed his line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How comes he by all that showy money, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Clydes, accustomed to their physician&rsquo;s hammerstroke turns of
      speech, took this under consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he wasn&rsquo;t committing murder in the church just now, I
      suppose,&rdquo; insinuated Mrs. Clyde at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not directly. His immediate business there, I suspect, was bribery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The minister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Strong!&rdquo; protested Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Mr. Huddleston
      isn&rsquo;t an intellectual giant, I grant you; but he&rsquo;s certainly a
      well-meaning and honorable old fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some cynical philosopher has remarked that wicked men have a talent
      for doing harm, but fools have a genius. Mr. Huddleston&rsquo;s goodness
      and honesty, taken in connection with his hopeless ignorance of human
      nature, are just so much capital to hand for a scoundrel like this Gray.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he expect to get for his twenty-dol-lar bill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, a reputation for piety and generosity. Second, that
      reputation duly certified to by the leading minister of the town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, a testimonial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. For home use, and cheap at twenty dollars. Preparatory
      to operating in a town, your itinerating quack bribes two people&mdash;if
      he can. First, the editor of the local paper; second, the pastor of the
      leading church. The editor usually takes the money with his eyes wide
      open; the minister with his eyes tight shut.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can his eyes be shut to such a business?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because so much dust has been thrown in them by the so-called
      religious journals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t mean that religious journals exploit
      quackery in their pages!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the mainstay of the quack and patent medicine business,&rdquo;
      declared the Health Master. &ldquo;Leaving out the Christian Science
      papers, which, of course, don&rsquo;t touch this dirty money, the
      religious press of all denominations, with a few honorable individual
      exceptions, sells out to any form of medical fraud which has a dollar to
      spend. Is it strange that the judgment of some of the clergy, who
      implicitly trust in their sectarian publications, becomes distorted? It&rsquo;s
      an even chance that our Great Gray faker&rsquo;s advertisement is in the
      religious weekly which lies on Mr. Huddleston&rsquo;s study-table at this
      moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Sharpless turned around from her seat in front, where she always
      ensconced herself so that, as she put it, she could see what was coming in
      time to jump. &ldquo;I know it is,&rdquo; she stated quietly. &ldquo;For
      while I was waiting in the parsonage last week I picked up the &lsquo;Church
      Pillar&rsquo; and saw it there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust Grandma Sharpless&rsquo;s eyes not to miss anything that
      comes within their range,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I missed the sense of that advertisement till just now,&rdquo;
      retorted the old lady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just remembered about this Graham
      Gray.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; asked the Health Master with eagerness, for
      Mrs. Sharpless&rsquo;s memory was as reliable for retaining salient facts
      as her vision was for discerning them. &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only by his works. Last year a traveling doctor of that name
      stopped over at Greenvale, twenty miles down the river, and gave some of
      his lectures to Suffering Womanhood, or some such folderol. He got hold of
      Sally Griffin, niece of our farmer here, while she was visiting there.
      Sally&rsquo;s as sound as a pippin, except for an occasional spell of
      fool-in-the-head, and I guess no school of doctoring ever helps that
      common ailment much. Well, this Gray got her scared out of her wits with
      symptoms, and sold her twenty-five dollars&rsquo; worth of medicine to
      cure her of something or other she didn&rsquo;t have. Cured!&rdquo;
      sniffed the lively narrator. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t taken the stuff away
      from her and locked it up, I expect she&rsquo;d be in the churchyard by
      now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole philosophy of quackery explicated and punctured, by one
      who knows,&rdquo; chuckled Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your palaver with me, young man!&rdquo; returned the brisk
      old lady, who was devoted to the Health Master, and showed it by a policy
      of determined opposition of the letter and whole-hearted support of the
      spirit and deed, in all things. &ldquo;Probably he knows as much as most
      of your regular doctors, at that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least he seems to know human nature. That&rsquo;s the strong
      point of the charlatan. But have you got any of his medicine left?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I think I can lay my hands on what&rsquo;s left of it. I
      remember that Sally boohooed like a baby, grown woman that she is, when I
      took it away from her.&rdquo; Dr. Strong&rsquo;s eyebrows went up sharply.
      &ldquo;As soon as we get to the house I&rsquo;ll look it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On their arrival at the roomy old farmstead which Mr. Clyde had remodeled
      and modernized for what he called &ldquo;an occasional three days of grace&rdquo;
      from his business in the city of Worthington, Grandma Sharpless set about
      the search, and presently came to the living-room bearing in one hand a
      large bottle and in the other a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re interested in Professor Gray,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what he says about himself in yesterday&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Bairdstown Bugle.&rsquo; I do think,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that
      the Honorable Silas Harris might be in better business with his paper than
      publishing such truck as this. Listen to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      <i>GOSPEL HERBS WILL CURE YOUR ILLS</i>

      all men, I can brew this miracle-working elixir.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blasphemous old slinkum!&rdquo; Grandma Sharpless interrupted
      herself to say angrily. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even quote the Scriptures
      right!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, blasphemy is a small matter for a rascal of his kind,&rdquo;
      said the Health Master lightly. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She read on:&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      Prof. Graham Gray,
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Gray Benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sharpless held out for the general view the advertisement, which
      occupied, in huge type, two thirds of a page of the &ldquo;Bugle.&rdquo;
      The remainder of the page was taken up with testimonials to the marvelous
      effects of the Gospel Herbs. Most of the letters were from far-away towns,
      but there were a few from the general vicinity of Bairdsville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Dr. Strong had been delicately tasting and smelling the contents
      of the bottle, which were thick and reddish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make out is in it?&rdquo; asked Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death&mdash;and a few worse things. Grandma Sharpless, you say that
      the girl cried for this after you took it from her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only that; she wrote to the Professor for more. And when it
      came I smashed the bottle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have the honorary degree of M.D. Well, it&rsquo;s
      pretty plain, but to make sure I&rsquo;ll send this to Worthington for an
      analysis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So our friend, the gray wolf, is going to prowl in Bairdstown for
      the next three days!&rdquo; Thomas Clyde began to rub his chin softly;
      then not so softly; and presently quite hard. His wife watched him with
      troubled eyes. When his hand came down to rest upon his knee, it was
      doubled into a very competent-looking fist. His face set in the expression
      which the newspapers of his own city had dubbed, after the tenement
      campaign of the year before, &ldquo;Clyde&rsquo;s fighting smile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Tom!&rdquo; broke out his wife, &ldquo;what kind of trouble are
      you going to get into now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; repeated the head of the family, in well-simulated
      surprise. &ldquo;Why, dear, I wasn&rsquo;t even thinking of trouble&mdash;for
      myself. But I believe it is time for a little action. Let&rsquo;s call
      this a household meeting&rdquo; (this was one of the established methods
      of the Clyde clan) &ldquo;and find out. As it isn&rsquo;t a family affair,
      we won&rsquo;t call in the children this time. Strong, what, if anything,
      are we going to do about this stranger in our midst? Are we going to let
      him take us in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong quickly, &ldquo;whether the
      Clyde family is willing to loan its subsidized physician temporarily to
      the city of Bairdstown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the Chinese plan,&rdquo; supplemented Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. On the Chinese plan of trying to save the community from
      a visitation instead of waiting to cure them of the incurable results of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By visitation I suppose you mean Professor Gray?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I should rank him rather higher than an epidemic of
      scarlet fever, as an ally of damage and death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vote &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde rather
      plaintively. &ldquo;Only, I wish you two men didn&rsquo;t have so much
      Irish in your temperament.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scorn your insinuation,&rdquo; replied her husband. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      the original dove of peace, but this Gray person ruffles my plumage. What
      do you say, Grandma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bairdstown is my own place, partly. I know the people and they know
      me and I won&rsquo;t sit quiet and see &lsquo;em put upon. I vote &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it unanimous!&rdquo; said Clyde. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the first
      move of the army of relief? I&rsquo;m in on this somewhere, Strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contribute your car for a couple of days, then, and we&rsquo;ll go
      out on a still hunt for the elusive clue and the shy and retiring
      evidence. In other words, we&rsquo;ll scour the county, and look up some
      of these local testimonials which the Great Gray One gathered in last
      year, and now prints in the &lsquo;Bugle.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll stop in town and see Mr. Huddleston to-morrow,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get any results,&rdquo; prophesied the Health
      Master. &ldquo;But, anyway, get him to come to the Gray lecture on Tuesday
      evening. We&rsquo;ll need him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During the ensuing two and a half days and two nights Mrs. Clyde had
      speech of her husband but once; and that was at 2 a.m. when he woke her up
      to tell her that he was having the time of his life, and she replied by
      asking him whether he had let the cat in, and returned to her dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bairdstown&rsquo;s Suffering Womanhood&mdash;as per advertisement&mdash;turned
      out extensively and self-commiseratingly to the free lecture of Tuesday
      evening, bringing with them a considerable admixture of the male populace,
      curious, cynical, or expectant. On the platform sat a number of &ldquo;special
      guests,&rdquo; including the Rev. Mr. Huddleston, mild of face and white
      of hair, and the Honorable Silas Harris, owner of the &ldquo;Bugle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cured&rdquo; patients, to the number of half a dozen, fidgeted in
      the seats of honor with expressions of conscious and pleasurable
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They appear to be enjoying poor health quite literally,&rdquo;
      whispered Clyde to Dr. Strong, as the two, begrimed with the dust of a
      long day&rsquo;s travel just finished, slipped quietly into side seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the entertainment began. A lank, harshfaced, muscular man whom
      Professor Gray introduced as his assistant, seated himself at the piano,
      and struck a chord, whereupon the Professor, in a powerful voice, sang
      what he termed the &ldquo;Hymn of Healing,&rdquo; inviting the audience to
      &ldquo;assist&rdquo; in the chorus, which gem of poesy ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Ye shall be healed! Ye shall be healed!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Trust in the gospel advice.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Cured by the herbs of the wood and the field;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Healed without money or price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some poetic license in that last line,&rdquo; murmured Clyde to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next portion of our programme,&rdquo; announced the Great Gray
      Benefactor, &ldquo;will be corroborative readings from the Good Book.&rdquo;
      And he proceeded to deliver in oratorical style sundry Bible quotations so
      patched together and garbled as to ascribe, inferentially, miraculous
      powers to the Gospel Herbs. Then came the lecture proper, which was merely
      an amplification of the &ldquo;Bugle&rdquo; advertisement, interspersed
      with almanac funny stories and old jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, before our demonstration,&rdquo; concluded Professor
      Graham Gray, &ldquo;if there is any here seeking enlightenment or help,
      let him rise. This is your meeting, dear friends, as much as mine; free to
      your voices and your needs, as well as to your welcome presence here. I
      court inquiry and fair investigation. Any questions? If not, we&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; The whole assemblage turned, as on a single
      pivot, to the side aisle where Dr. Strong had risen and now stood, tall,
      straight, and composed, waiting for silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend on the right has the floor,&rdquo; said the Professor
      suavely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You state that this God-given secret remedy was imparted to you for
      the relief of human misery?&rdquo; asked Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thousands of grateful patients attest it, my friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, with human beings suffering and dying all about you, why do
      you continue to profit by keeping it secret?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Down sat the questioner. A murmur rose and ran, as the logic of the
      question struck home. But the quack had his answer pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not the Good Book say that the laborer is worthy of his hire?
      Do your regular physicians, of whom I understand you are one, treat cases
      for nothing? Ah,&rdquo; he went on, outstretching his hands to the
      audience with a gesture of appeal, &ldquo;the injustice which I have
      suffered from the jealousy and envy of the medical profession! Never do I
      enter a town without curing many unfortunates that the regular doctors
      have given up as hopeless. Hence the violence of their attacks upon me.
      But I forgive them their prejudice, as I pity their ignorance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some applause followed the enunciation of this noble sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have with us to-night,&rdquo; pursued the speaker, quick to
      catch the veering sentiment, &ldquo;a number of these marvelous cures. You
      shall hear from the very mouths of the saved ones testimony beyond cavil.
      I will call first on Mrs. Amanda Gryce, wife of Mr. Stanley Gryce, the
      well and favorably known laundryman. Speak up clearly, Mrs. Gryce, and
      tell your story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s two years now that I been doctorin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
      the lady thus adjured, in a fluttering voice. &ldquo;I doctored with a
      allopathic physician here, an&rsquo; with a homypath over to Roxton, an&rsquo;
      with a osty-path down to Worthington, an&rsquo; with Peruny in betwixt, an&rsquo;
      they didn&rsquo;t any of &lsquo;em do me no good till I tried Professor
      Gray. He seen how I felt without askin&rsquo; me a question. He just
      pulled down my eyelid an&rsquo; looked at it. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re all run down;
      gone!&rsquo; says he. An&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s jest what I was. So he
      treated me with his herb medicine an&rsquo; I feel like a new woman. An&rsquo;
      I give Professor Graham Gray the credit an&rsquo; the thanks of a saved
      woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to mention seven dollars an&rsquo; a half,&rdquo; supplemented
      a mournful drawl from the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hush, Stan Gryce!&rdquo; cried the healed one, shrill above the
      laughter of the ribald. &ldquo;Would you begrutch a few mizzable dollars
      for your poor, sufferin&rsquo; wife&rsquo;s health?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An alarmed child of ten was next led forward and recited in sing-song
      measure:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;had&mdash;the&mdash;fits&mdash;for&mdash;most&mdash;three&mdash;years&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;was&mdash;cured&mdash;by
      Gospel&mdash;Herbs&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;have&mdash;come&mdash;here&mdash;to&mdash;say&mdash;God&mdash;bless&mdash;my&mdash;dear
      benefactor&mdash;Professor&mdash;Graham&mdash;Gray,&rdquo;&mdash;and sat
      down hard at the last word, whereupon a tenor squeak in the far gallery
      took up the refrain:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d scarcex peckwon of my yage
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To speakin public on the stage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a surge of mirth, and the lecturer frowned with concern.
      But he quickly covered whatever misgivings he might have had by bringing
      forward other &ldquo;testimonies&rdquo;: old Miss Smithson whose
      nervousness had been quite dispelled by two doses of the herbs; Auntie
      Thomas (colored) whose &ldquo;misery&rdquo; had vanished before the
      wonder-working treatment; and the Widow Carlin, whose boy had been &ldquo;spittin&rsquo;
      blood like as if he was churchyard doomed,&rdquo; but hadn&rsquo;t had a
      bad coughing spell since taking the panacea. And all this time Dr. Strong
      sat quiet in his seat, with a face of darkening sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard your fellow-citizens,&rdquo; the lecturer took up
      his theme again, &ldquo;testify to the efficacy of my methods. And you see
      on this rostrum with me that grand and good old man, the worthy pastor of
      so many of you, my dear and honored friend&mdash;I feel that I may call
      him friend, since I have his approval of my humble labors&mdash;the
      Reverend Doctor Huddleston. You see also here, lending the support of his
      valued presence, the Honorable Silas Harris, whom you have twice honored
      by sending him to the state legislature. Their presence is the proudest
      testimonial to my professional character. In Mr. Harris&rsquo;s fearless
      and independent journal you have read the sworn evidence of those who have
      been cured by my Godgiven remedies; evidence which is beyond challenge&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I challenge it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong, who had been hopefully awaiting some such opening, was on his
      feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had your say!&rdquo; cried Professor Gray, menacing him
      with a shaking hand. &ldquo;These people don&rsquo;t want to hear you.
      They understand your motives. You can&rsquo;t run this meeting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gesture was a signal. The raw-boned accompanist, whose secondary
      function was that of bouncer, made a quick advance from the rear, reached
      for the unsuspicious Health Master&mdash;and recoiled from the impact of
      Mr. Thomas Clyde&rsquo;s solid shoulder so sharply that only the side wall
      checked his subsidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better stay out of harm&rsquo;s way, my friend,&rdquo; suggested
      Clyde amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the hall was in an uproar. The more timid of the women were
      making for the exits, when a high, shrill voice, calling for order
      strenuously, quelled the racket, and a very fat man waddled down the
      middle aisle, to be greeted by cries of &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the Mayor.&rdquo;
      Several excited volunteers explained the situation to him from as many
      different points of view, while Professor Graham Gray bellowed his appeal
      from the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I want is fair play. They&rsquo;re trying to break up my
      meeting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; returned Dr. Strong&rsquo;s calm voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      more than anxious to have it continue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a happy inspiration, Mr. Clyde jumped up on his bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move Mayor Allen take the chair!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Professor
      Gray says that he courts fair investigation. Let&rsquo;s give it to him,
      in order.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A shout of acclaim greeted this suggestion. Bairdstown&rsquo;s Suffering
      Womanhood and Bored Manhood was getting more out of a free admission than
      it had ever had in its life before. Ponderously the obese Mayor hoisted
      his weight up the steps and shook hands with the reluctant lecturer. He
      then invited Dr. Strong to come to the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my meeting!&rdquo; protested the Great Gray Benefactor.
      &ldquo;I hired this hall and paid good money for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said it was our meeting as much as yours!&rdquo; roared an
      insurgent from the crowd, and a chorus of substantiation followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes will be all that I want,&rdquo; announced Dr. Strong as
      he took a chair next the Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair!&rdquo; shrilled the Chairman. &ldquo;On the
      Professor&rsquo;s own invitation.&rdquo; In a tone lowered to the alarmed
      quack&rsquo;s ear, he added: &ldquo;Of course, you can back out if you
      want to. But I&rsquo;d advise you to do it quick if you&rsquo;re going to
      do it at all. This is a queer-tempered town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So significant was his tone that the other judged advance to be safer than
      retreat. Therefore, summoning all his assurance, he sought, in an
      impassioned speech, to win back his hearers. He was a natural orator, and,
      when he reached his peroration, he had a large part of his audience with
      him again. In the flush of renewed confidence he made a grave tactical
      error, just when he should have closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let this hireling of the Doctors&rsquo; Trust, the trust that would
      strangle all honest competition, answer these if he can!&rdquo; he
      shouted, shaking the page of testimonials before his adversary&rsquo;s
      face. &ldquo;Let him confute the evidence of these good and honorable
      women who have appeared here to-night; women who have no selfish aims to
      subserve. Let him impugn the motives of the reverend clergyman and of the
      honored statesman who sit here with me. Let him do this, or let him shrink
      from this hall in the shame and dishonor which he seeks to heap upon one
      whose sole ambition it is to relieve suffering and banish pain and death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was hearty applause as the speaker sat down and Dr. Strong arose to
      face a gathering now turned for the most part hostile. He wasted no time
      in introduction or argument. &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Professor
      Gray rests his case on his testimonials. With Mr. Clyde I have
      investigated a number of them, and will give you my results. Here are half
      a dozen testimonials to the value of one of his nostrums, the Benefaction
      Pills, from women who have been cured, so they state, of diseases ranging
      from eczema through indigestion to consumption. All, please note, by the
      same wonderful medicine. And here,&rdquo; he drew a small box from his
      pocket, &ldquo;is a sample of the medicine. I have just had it analyzed.
      What do you suppose they are? Sugar! Just plain sugar and nothing else.&rdquo;
      Professor Gray leaped to his feet. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deny the cures!&rdquo;
      he thundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that these people are well to-day. And I don&rsquo;t
      deny that the testimonials from them are genuine, as documents. But your
      sugar pills had no more to do with the cure than so much moonshine.
      Listen, you people! Here is the core and secret of quackery:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All diseases tend to cure themselves, through the natural
      resistance of the body. But for that we should all be dead. This man, or
      some other of his kind, comes along with his promises and pills, and when
      the patient recovers from the disease in the natural course of events, he
      claims the credit. Meantime, he is selling sugar at about one hundred
      dollars per pound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sugar,&rdquo; said the quack, quick-wittedly. &ldquo;But what kind
      of sugar? This sugar, as he calls it, is crystal precipitated from the
      extract of these healing herbs. No chemist can determine its properties by
      any analysis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well turned,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, with a smile. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t immediately disprove that, though I could with time. But,
      whatever the case with his sugar, any chemist can analyze this.&rdquo; He
      held up a small bottle, half filled with a red-brown liquid. &ldquo;This
      is the Extract of Gospel Herbs. Now, let us see what this does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He referred to his copy of the &ldquo;Bugle,&rdquo; containing the
      testimonials. &ldquo;Here is Mrs. Sarah Jenkins, of the neighboring town
      of Maresco, where Professor Gray lectured a year ago, cured of Bright&rsquo;s
      disease and dropsy; Miss Allie Wheat, of Weedsport, cured of cancer of the
      stomach; and Mrs. Howard Cleary, of Roxton, wholly relieved of nervous
      breakdown and insomnia. All genuine testimonials. Mr. Clyde and I have
      traced them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Gray raised his head with a flash of triumph. &ldquo;You see!&rdquo;
      he cried. &ldquo;He has to admit the genuineness of my testimonials!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your testimonials; yes. But what about your cures? Mrs. Jenkins
      has, as she said, ceased to suffer from her ills. She died of Bright&rsquo;s
      disease and dropsy three months after Professor Gray cured her of them.
      Miss Wheat, whose cancer was purely imaginary, is now a hopeless wreck, in
      a sanitarium whither the Gospel Herbs drove her. Mrs. Cleary&mdash;but let
      me read what she testified to. Here it is in the paper with a picture of
      the Cleary home:&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Professor Gray: You have indeed been a benefactor to me. Before
      our baby was born my husband and I were the happiest of couples. Then I
      became a nervous wreck. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I was cross and irritable.
      My nerves seemed all on fire. Your first treatment worked wonders. I slept
      like a log. Since then I have not been without Gospel Herbs in the house,
      and I am a well woman. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      (Signed) Mrs. Howard Cleary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a year ago,&rdquo; continued Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Yesterday
      we visited the Cleary home. We found a broken husband and a deserted baby.
      The young wife we traced to Worthington, where we discovered her&mdash;well,
      I won&rsquo;t name to this audience the sort of place we found her in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But so far as there can be a hell on this earth, she had descended
      into it, and this,&rdquo; he held the vial high to view, &ldquo;<i>this</i>
      sent her there.&rdquo; His fingers opened; there was a crisp little crash
      of glass, and the red-brown liquid crept and spread along the floor, like
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morphine,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Morphine, which enslaves
      the body and destroys the soul. There are your Gospel Herbs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur rose, and deepened into a growl. The Great Gray Benefactor, his
      face livid, sprang forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;All lies! Where&rsquo;s his proof?
      What&rsquo;s he got to show? Nothing but his own say-so. If there&rsquo;s
      a law in the land, I&rsquo;ll make him sweat for this. Mr. Huddleston, I
      appeal to you for justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be glad to hear from the Reverend Mr. Huddleston,&rdquo;
      mildly suggested the chairman, who was evincing an enjoyment of the
      proceedings quite puzzling to Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old clergyman got slowly to his feet. His mild, weak face was
      troubled. &ldquo;Let us bear and forbear,&rdquo; he pleaded in a tremulous
      voice. &ldquo;I cannot believe these charges against our good friend,
      Professor Gray. I am sure that he is a good and worthy man. He has given
      most liberally to the church. I am informed that he is a member of his
      home church in good and regular standing, and I find in the editorial
      columns of the &lsquo;Church Pillar&rsquo; a warm encomium upon his
      beneficent work, advising all to try his remedies. Surely our friend, Dr.
      Strong, has been led astray by mistaken zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only yesterday two members of my congregation, most estimable
      ladies, called to see me and told me how they had benefited by a visit
      just made to Professor Gray. He had treated them with his new Gospel
      Elixir, of which he has spoken to me. There was evidence of its efficacy
      in their very bearing and demeanor&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say there was! <i>And</i> in their breath. Did you smell
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The interruption came in a very clear, positive, and distinct contralto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Grimes&rsquo;s grass-green ghost!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Thomas
      Clyde, quite audibly amidst the startled hush. &ldquo;Grandma Sharpless is
      among those present!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I do not think,&rdquo; began the clergyman,
      aghast, &ldquo;that the matter occurred to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if <i>you</i> didn&rsquo;t, <i>I</i> did,&rdquo; continued
      the voice composedly. &ldquo;They reeked of liquor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension to which the gathering had been strung abruptly loosened in
      mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Sharpless will please take the platform,&rdquo; invited the
      Mayor-chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll do my talking from here.&rdquo; The old lady stood
      up, a straight, solid, uncompromising figure, in the center of the floor.
      &ldquo;I met those two ladies in the parsonage hall,&rdquo; she explained.
      &ldquo;They were coming out as I was going in. They stopped to talk to me.
      They both talked at once. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to say that they were&mdash;well&mdash;exactly&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spifflicated,&rdquo; suggested a helpful voice from the far rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spifflicated; thank you,&rdquo; accepted the speaker. &ldquo;But
      they certainly were&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lit up,&rdquo; volunteered another first-aid to the hesitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, lit up. One of them loaned me her bottle. If I&rsquo;m any
      judge of bad whiskey, that was it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An appreciative roar from the house testified to the fact that Mrs.
      Sharpless had her audience in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you women on the stage,&rdquo; she pursued, rising to her
      topic, &ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s wrong with you.&lsquo;Mandy Gryce, if
      you&rsquo;d tend more to your house and less to your symptoms, you wouldn&rsquo;t
      be flitting from allopathic bud to homoeopathic flower like a bumblebee
      with the stomach-ache.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; from Mr. Gryce.)
      &ldquo;Lizzie Tompy, your fits are nine tenths temper. I&rsquo;d cure you
      of &lsquo;em without morphine. Miss Smithson, if you&rsquo;d quit strong
      green tea, three times a day, those nerves of yours would give you a
      fairer chance&mdash;and your neighbors, too.&rdquo; (Tearful sniffs from
      Miss Smithson.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie Thomas, you wait and see what your rheumatism says to you
      to-morrow, when the dope has died out of your system. Susan Carlin, you
      ought to be home this minute, looking after your sick boy, instead of on a
      stage, in your best bib and tucker, giving testimonials to you-don&rsquo;t-know-what-all
      poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bairdstown&rsquo;s Suffering Womanhood!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      vigorous old lady, her color rising with her voice. &ldquo;Go home! Go
      home, you poor, self-coddling fussybuddies, to your washboards and your
      sewing-machines and forget your imaginary symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she drew a long breath, looking about over the group
      of wilting testimonial-givers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first speech I have
      ever made, and I guess it&rsquo;ll be the last. But before I stop, I&rsquo;ve
      got a word to say to you, Professor Graham Gray. Bless us! Where&rsquo;s
      the man gone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Gray,&rdquo; announced the chairman with a twinkle in his
      voice, &ldquo;has retired to obtain fresh evidence. At least, that is what
      he <i>said</i> he had gone for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the main floor came a hoarse suggestion which had the words &ldquo;tar
      and feathers&rdquo; in it. It was cut short by a metallic shriek from
      without, followed by a heavy rumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something seems to tell me,&rdquo; said the fat Mayor solemnly,
      &ldquo;that the 9.30 express, which just whistled for the crossing, is the
      heavier by about two hundred pounds of Great Gray Benefactor clinging to
      the rear platform, and happy to be there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your money back if not benefited,&rdquo; piped a reedy voice
      from the front, whereupon there was another roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bright particular star of these proceedings having left, is
      there anything else to come before the meeting?&rdquo; inquired the
      chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have one more word,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;Friends, as one quack is, all quacks are. They differ only in
      method and degree. Every one of them plays a game with stacked cards, in
      which you are his victims, and Death is his partner. And the puller-in for
      this game is the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard to-night how a good and wellmeaning clergyman has
      been made stool-pigeon for this murderous charlatan, through the lying of
      a religious&mdash;God save the mark!&mdash;weekly. That publication is
      beyond our reach. But there is one here at home which did the quack&rsquo;s
      work for him, and took his money for doing it. I suggest that the
      Honorable Silas Harris explain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running my paper as a business proposition,&rdquo;
      growled the baited editor and owner of the &lsquo;Bugle,&rsquo; &ldquo;and
      I&rsquo;m running it to suit myself and this community.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re running it to suit the crooked and cruel advertisers
      who prey on this community,&rdquo; retorted the other. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve
      served them further in the legislature, where you voted to kill the
      patent-medicine bill, last session, in protection of your own profits.
      Good profits, too. One third of all your advertising is medical quackery
      which takes good money out of this town by sheer swindling; money which
      ought to stay in town and be spent on the legitimate local products
      advertised in your paper. If I were a local advertiser, I&rsquo;d want to
      know why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Stanley Gryce, quick
      to catch the point, &ldquo;I guess you owe my family seven dollars an&rsquo;
      a half, Silas, and till it&rsquo;s paid up you can just drop my laundry
      announcement out of your columns.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll stay out for a spell, too,&rdquo; supplemented
      Mr. Corson, the hay and feed man. &ldquo;For a week, my ad&rsquo;s been
      swamped by Swamp Root so deep you can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you&rsquo;re about it,&rdquo; added a third, &ldquo;leave me
      out. I&rsquo;m kinder sick of appearin&rsquo; between a poisonous headache
      powder and a consumption dope. Folks&rsquo;ll be accusin&rsquo; me of
      seekin&rsquo; trade untimely.&rdquo; This was greeted with a whoop, for
      the speaker was the local undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a league for Clean Advertising in Worthington,&rdquo;
      announced Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Why not organize something of the kind here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; shouted the Honorable Silas, throwing up his hands.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot! I holler &lsquo;Enough!&rsquo; As soon as the
      contracts are out, I&rsquo;ll quit. There&rsquo;s no money in
      patent-medicine advertising any more for the small paper, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve done our evening&rsquo;s chores, I reckon,&rdquo;
      remarked the chairman. &ldquo;A motion to adjourn will now be in order.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move we adjourn with the chorus of the &lsquo;Hymn of Healing,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      piped the wag with the reedy voice, and the audience filed out,
      uproariously and profanely singing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Ye shall be healed! Ye shall be healed!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Trust in the gospel advice.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Cured by the herbs of the wood and the field;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Healed without money or price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, young man,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless, coming forward to
      join the Health Master, &ldquo;you certainly carried out your programme.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, affectionately tucking the old lady&rsquo;s
      arm under his. &ldquo;To you the honors of war. I only squelched a quack.
      You taught Bairds-town&rsquo;s self-coddling womanhood a lesson that will
      go down the generations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want to know,&rdquo; said the Mayor, advancing to shake
      hands with Mrs. Sharpless, &ldquo;is this: what&rsquo;s a fussybuddy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fussybuddy,&rdquo; instructed Grandma Sharpless wisely, &ldquo;is
      a woman who catches a stomach-ache from a patent-medicine almanac. What I
      want to know, Tom Allen, is what you had against the man. I seemed to get
      an inkling that you didn&rsquo;t exactly like him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgotten me,&rdquo; chuckled the Mayor, &ldquo;but I
      haven&rsquo;t forgotten him. Fifteen years ago he came along here
      horse-doctoring and poisoned a perfectly good mare for me. He won&rsquo;t
      try to poison this town again in a hurry. You finished him, Mrs.
      Sharpless, you and Dr. Strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>I</i> want to know,&rdquo; said the Health Master, &ldquo;is
      how poor old Mr. Huddleston feels about that contribution, now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A month later he found out. Traveling by trolley one evening, he felt a
      hand on his shoulder, and turned to face Professor Graham Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hard feelings, I hope,&rdquo; said the quack with superb
      urbanity. &ldquo;All in the way of business, I take it. I&rsquo;d have
      done the same to you, if you&rsquo;d come butting in on my trade. Say, but
      that old lady was a Tartar! She cooked my goose in Bairdstown. For all
      that, I got an unsolicited testimonial from there two weeks ago that&rsquo;s
      a wonder. Anonymous, too. Not a word of writing with it to tell who the
      grateful patient might be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Dr. Strong with polite interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A twenty-dollar bill. Now, <i>what</i> do you think of that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Strong spoke again&mdash;and the Great Gray Benefactor has always
      regarded this as the most inconsequential reply he ever received to a
      plain question&mdash;it was after a long and thoughtful pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he with conviction, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ll
      start in going to church again, next Sunday.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      X.&mdash;THE HOUSE THAT CAUGHT COLD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;C</span>an you cure
      a cold?&rdquo; asked Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flare from the soft-coal fire flickered across the library, revealing a
      smile on the Health Master&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a millionaire?&rdquo; he countered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from your salary as Chinese physician to the Clydes,&rdquo;
      laughed the head of that family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could cure a cold, I should be, easily, more than that. I&rsquo;d
      be the foremost medical discoverer of the day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t cure a cold,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> a cold?&rdquo; countered the Health Master in that
      insinuating tone of voice which he employed to provoke the old lady into
      one of those frequent verbal encounters so thoroughly enjoyed by both of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ordinary common cold in the head. You know what I mean perfectly
      well, young man. The kind you catch by getting into drafts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that!</i> Well, you see, there&rsquo;s no such thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing as a cold in the head, Dr. Strong?&rdquo; said Julia,
      looking up from her book. &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve all had &lsquo;em, loads
      of times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bettina is coming down with one now, if I&rsquo;m any judge,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s had the sniffles all day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope it isn&rsquo;t a cold. Maybe it&rsquo;s only
      chicken-pox or mumps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you wishing chicken-pox and mumps on my baby?&rdquo; cried Mrs.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the three years during which Dr. Strong had been the &ldquo;Chinese
      physician&rdquo; of the household, earning his salary by keeping his
      patients well instead of curing them when ill, Mrs. Clyde had never quite
      learned to guard against the surprises which so often pointed the Health
      Master&rsquo;s truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by any means; I&rsquo;m only hoping for the lesser of evils.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mumps and chicken-pox are real diseases,&rdquo; protested
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that a &lsquo;cold,&rsquo; as you call it, isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Clyde hesitantly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call
      it a disease, any more than I&rsquo;d call a sprain a broken leg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is. A very real, serious disease. Its actual name is coryza.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bogy-talk,&rdquo; commented Grandma Sharpless scornfully. &ldquo;Big
      names for little things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a little thing at all, as we should all realize if our official
      death-records really dealt in facts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death-records?&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless incredulously. &ldquo;People
      don&rsquo;t die of colds, do they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundreds every year; all around us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> never hear of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure? Think back and recall how many of your friends&rsquo;
      obituary notices include some such sentence as this: &lsquo;Last Thursday
      evening Mr. Smith caught a severe cold, from which he took to his bed on
      Saturday, and did not leave it again until his death yesterday morning?&rsquo;
      Doesn&rsquo;t that sound familiar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So familiar,&rdquo; cried Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;that I believe the
      newspapers keep it set up in type.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the newspaper always goes on to say that Mr. Smith developed
      pneumonia or grip or bronchitis, and died of that, not of the cold,&rdquo;
      objected Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. In the mortality records poor Smith usually appears under
      the heading of one of the well-recognized diseases. It would hardly be
      respectable to die of a cold, would it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t <i>die</i> of the cold,&rdquo; insisted the old
      lady. &ldquo;He catches the cold and dies of something else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I take a dose of poison,&rdquo; the Health Master mildly
      propounded, &ldquo;and fall down and break my neck, what do I die of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no parallel,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless. &ldquo;And
      even if it is,&rdquo; she added, tacitly abandoning that ground, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
      always had colds and we always will have &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with my approval, at least,&rdquo; remarked the Health Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess Providence won&rsquo;t wait for your approval, young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you regard coryza as a dispensation of Providence? The
      Presbyterian doctrine of foreordination, applied to the human nose,&rdquo;
      smiled the physician. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all predestined to the ailment,
      and therefore might as well get out our handkerchiefs and prepare to
      sneeze our poor sinful heads off. Is that about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t! This is a green December and it means a full
      churchyard. We&rsquo;re in for a regular cold-breeding season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Weather doesn&rsquo;t breed colds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very mean and lively little germ. He&rsquo;s rather more
      poisonous than the chicken-pox and mumps variety, although he hasn&rsquo;t
      as bad a name. In grown-ups he prepares the soil, so to speak, for other
      germs, by getting all through the system and weakening its resistant
      powers, thereby laying it open to the attacks of such enemies as the
      pneumococcus, which is always waiting just around the corner of the tongue
      to give us pneumonia. Or bronchitis may develop, or tonsillitis, or
      diphtheria, or kidney trouble, or indeed almost anything. I once heard an
      eminent lecturer happily describe the coryza bacillus as the bad little
      boy of the gang who, having once broken into the system, turns around and
      calls back to the bigger boys: &lsquo;Come on in, fellers. The door&rsquo;s
      open.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With children the coryza-bug makes various trouble without
      necessarily inviting the others in. A great proportion of the serious
      ear-troubles come from colds; all the way from earache to mastoiditis, and
      the consequent necessity of quick operations to save the patient&rsquo;s
      life. Almost any of the organs may be impaired by the activity of the
      little pest. And yet as intelligent a family as this&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked around the circle&mdash;&ldquo;considers it a &lsquo;mere cold.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you told us before?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A just reproach,&rdquo; admitted the Health Master. &ldquo;Not
      having been attacked, I haven&rsquo;t considered defense&mdash;a wretched
      principle in health matters. In fact, I&rsquo;ve let the little matters of
      life go, too much, in my interest in the bigger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about Bettina?&rdquo; said the mother anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have her in,&rdquo; said the Health Master, and the
      six-year-old presently trotted into the room, announcing through a
      somewhat reddened nose, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all stobbed ub; and Katie rubbed
      me with goose-grease, and I don&rsquo;d wand to take any paregoric.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paregoric?&rdquo; said the physician. &ldquo;Opium? I guess not.
      Off to bed with you, Toots, and we&rsquo;ll try to exorcise the demon with
      hot-water bottles and extra blankets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Following her usual custom of kissing everybody good-night around the
      circle, Bettina held up her arms to her sister, who was nearest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said the Health Master. &ldquo;No kissing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even my mamma?&rdquo; queried the child. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid not. You remember when Charley had scarlet fever he wasn&rsquo;t
      allowed even to be very near any of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But scarlet fever is the most contagious of any of the diseases,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as contagious as a cold in the head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how contagious a cold is,&rdquo; said Grandma
      Sharpless; &ldquo;but I do know this: once it gets into a house, it goes
      through it like wildfire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the house ought to be ashamed of itself. That&rsquo;s sheer
      carelessness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half the kids in our school have got stopped-up noses,&rdquo;
      contributed Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t the Committee on Schools reported the fact?&rdquo;
      demanded the Health Master, turning an accusing eye on Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I didn&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t think it was anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t! Well, if what Charley says is correct, I
      should think your school ought to be put under epidemic regimen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have a fine row with the Board of Education, trying to
      persuade them to special action for any such cause as that,&rdquo;
      remarked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the measure of their intelligence, then,&rdquo;
      returned the Health Master. &ldquo;Sickness is sickness, just as surely as
      a flame is fire; and there is no telling, once it&rsquo;s well started,
      how much damage it may do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a cold is only in the head, or rather, in the nose,&rdquo;
      persisted Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong. Coryza is a disease of the
      whole system, and it weakens the whole system. The symptoms are most
      apparent in the nose and mouth: and it is from the nose and mouth that the
      disease is spread. But if you&rsquo;ve got the cold you&rsquo;ve got it in
      every corner of your being. You won&rsquo;t be convinced of its
      importance, I suppose, until I can produce facts and figures. I only hope
      they won&rsquo;t be producible from this house. But by the end of the
      season I&rsquo;ll hope to have them. Meantime we&rsquo;ll isolate
      Bettykin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bettina was duly isolated. Meanwhile the active little coryza bacillus had
      got its grip on Mr. Clyde, who for three days attended to his business
      with streaming eyes, and then retired, in the company of various hot-water
      bags, bottles, and foot-warmers, to the sanctuary of his own bedroom,
      where he led a private and morose existence for one week. His general
      manager succeeded to his desk; likewise, to his contaminated pencils,
      erasers, and other implements, whereby he alternately sneezed and
      objurgated himself into the care of a doctor, with the general and
      unsatisfactory result that the balance-sheet of Clyde &amp; Co.,
      Manufacturers, showed an obvious loss for the month&mdash;as it happened,
      most unfortunately, an unusually busy month&mdash;of some three thousand
      dollars, directly traceable to that unconsidered trifle, a cold in the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that you got off cheap,&rdquo; argued the Health Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three months after the invasion of the Clyde household by Bettina&rsquo;s
      coryza germ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad somebody considers it cheap!&rdquo; observed Mr.
      Clyde. &ldquo;Personally I should rather have taken a trip to Europe on my
      share of that three thousand dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you were lucky,&rdquo; asserted Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Bettykin got
      through her earache without any permanent damage. Robin&rsquo;s attack
      passed off without complications. Your own onset didn&rsquo;t involve any
      organ more vital than your bank account. And the rest of us escaped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it prove what I said,&rdquo; demanded Grandma
      Sharpless; &ldquo;that a cold in the head is only a cold in the head?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Answer is No,&rsquo; as Togo would put it,&rdquo; replied
      the Health Master. &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;ve got proof here of quite the
      opposite, which I desire to present to this gathering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This meeting of the Household Protective Association is hereby
      called to order!&rdquo; announced Mr. Clyde, in the official tones proper
      to the occasion. The children put aside their various occupations and
      assumed a solemn and businesslike aspect which was part of the game.
      &ldquo;The lone official member will now report,&rdquo; concluded the
      chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the Health Officer of the city report for me,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Strong, taking a printed leaflet from his pocket. &ldquo;He is one of
      those rare officials who aren&rsquo;t afraid to tell people what they don&rsquo;t
      know, and may not want to know. Listen to what Dr. Merritt has to say.&rdquo;
      And he read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The death-rate of the city for the month of February, like
      the rate for December and January, is abnormally high, being a shade over
      ten per cent above the normal for this time of year. While the causes of
      mortality range through the commoner diseases, with a special rise in
      pulmonary troubles, it is evident that the increase must be due to some
      special cause. In the opinion of the Bureau of Health this cause is the
      despised and infectious &ldquo;cold,&rdquo; more properly known as coryza,
      which has been epidemic this winter in the city. Although the epidemic
      wave is now receding, its disastrous aftereffects may be looked for in
      high mortality rates for some months. Should a similar onset occur again,
      the city will be asked to consider seriously a thorough school campaign,
      with careful isolation of all suspicious cases.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you write that, young man?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Sharpless
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no; I didn&rsquo;t <i>write</i> it,&rdquo; answered the Health
      Master. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go as far as to admit, however, that Dr. Merritt
      listens politely to my humble suggestions when I offer them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Ten per cent increase. What is that in real figures?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five extra deaths a month,&rdquo; said Manny Clyde, a
      growing expert on local statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-five needless deaths for the three months, and more to
      come,&rdquo; said the Health Master, &ldquo;besides all the disability,
      loss of time and earning power and strength, and all the pain and
      suffering&mdash;which things never get into the vital statistics, worse
      luck! So much to the account of the busy little coryza-bug.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t the Health Bureau do something?&rdquo; asked the
      practical Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, until its public is better educated,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Strong wearily. &ldquo;The present business of a health official is to try
      and beat the fool-killer off from his natural prey with a printed tract.
      It&rsquo;s quite a job, when you come to consider it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he ought to have, is the club of the law!&rdquo; said Mr.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. The people won&rsquo;t give it to him. In this household
      we&rsquo;re better off, since we can make our own laws. Since Betty&rsquo;s
      attack we&rsquo;ve tried out the isolation plan pretty effectually; and we&rsquo;ve
      followed, as well as might be, the rule of avoiding contact with people
      having coryza.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up at a flamboyant poster which Mrs. Clyde, who had a natural
      gift of draftsmanship, had made in a spirit of mischief, entitling it
      &ldquo;The Red Nose as a Danger Signal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much truth as fun in that,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;But, at
      the best, we can&rsquo;t live among people and avoid all danger. In fact,
      avoidance is only the outer line of defense. The inner line is symbolized
      by a homely rule, &lsquo;Keep Comfortable.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s comfort to do with keeping well?&rdquo; asked Grandma
      Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your nerves for?&rdquo; retorted Dr. Strong with his
      quizzical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the old lady plaintively, &ldquo;did I ever
      ask you a question that you didn&rsquo;t fire another back at me before it
      was fairly out of my mouth? My nerves, if I let myself have any, wouldn&rsquo;t
      be for anything except to plague me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those are pampered nerves. Normal nerves are to warn you. They&rsquo;re
      to tell you whether the little things of life are right with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they&rsquo;re not?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then you&rsquo;re uncomfortable. Which is to say, there&rsquo;s
      something wrong; and something wrong means, in time, a lessening of
      vitality, and when you let down your body&rsquo;s vitality you&rsquo;re
      simply saying to any germ that may happen along, &lsquo;Come right in and
      make yourself at home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you remember when the house caught cold, how shocked
      Grandma Sharpless was at my saying that colds aren&rsquo;t caught in a
      draft. Well, they&rsquo;re not. Yet I ought to have qualified that. Now,
      what is a draft? Air in motion. If there is one thing about air that we
      thoroughly know, it&rsquo;s this: that moving air is infinitely better for
      us than still air. Even bad, stale air, if stirred vigorously into motion,
      seems to purify itself and become breathable and good. Now, the danger of
      a draft is that it may mean a sudden change of the body&rsquo;s
      temperature. Nobody thinks that wind is unhealthful, because when you&rsquo;re
      out in the wind&mdash;which is the biggest and freest kind of a draft&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      prepared for it. If not, your nerves say to you, &lsquo;Move faster; get
      warm.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the same indoors. If the draft chills you, your
      nerves will tell you so. Therefore, mind your nerves. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll
      become specially receptive to the coryza germ and when you&rsquo;ve caught
      <i>that</i>, you&rsquo;ll have caught cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;that my nerves would tell
      me why I feel so logy every morning. They don&rsquo;t say anything
      definite. It isn&rsquo;t indigestion exactly. But I feel slow and inert
      after breakfast, as if my stomach hadn&rsquo;t any enthusiasm in its job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast is the only meal I don&rsquo;t have with you, so I don&rsquo;t
      know,&rdquo; replied the Health Master, who was a very early riser.
      &ldquo;But I should say you were eating the wrong things, perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could that be?&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Tom has the
      simplest kind of breakfast, and it&rsquo;s the same every day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you are.&rdquo; The Health Master&rsquo;s tone assumed
      that the solution was found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; queried Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m up in the
      air!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this remarkably regular breakfast?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eggs, rolls, and coffee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Eggs every morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of them. Medium boiled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even the method is varied. Same eggs, same preparation every
      morning, seven days a week, four weeks a month, twelve months&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s my winter breakfast only.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; four or five months in the year. No wonder your poor
      stomach gets bored.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with eggs, Dr. Strong?&rdquo; inquired
      Manny. &ldquo;They let us have &lsquo;em, in training.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is the matter with two eggs, or twenty. But when you come
      to two hundred, there&rsquo;s something very obvious the matter&mdash;monotony.
      Your stomach is a machine, it&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s a human
      machine. It demands variety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Charles ought to be a model. He wants everything from soup to
      pie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thoroughly normal desire for a growing boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He eats an awful lot of meat,&rdquo; observed Julia, who was a
      somewhat fastidious young lady. &ldquo;My Sunday-school teacher calls
      meat-eaters human tigers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s too easy a generalization, Junkum,&rdquo; replied
      the Health Master. &ldquo;With equal logic she could say that
      vegetable-eaters are human cows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the vegetarians make very strong arguments,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of pale-eyed, weak-blooded nibblers!&rdquo; stated Grandma
      Sharpless. &ldquo;If meat weren&rsquo;t good for us, we wouldn&rsquo;t
      have been eating it all these generations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. Perhaps we eat a little too much of it, particularly
      in the warm months. But in winter it&rsquo;s practically a necessity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the big athletes say they&rsquo;re vegetarians,&rdquo; said
      Manny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are individual cases,&rdquo; admitted the Health Master;
      &ldquo;but in the long run it doesn&rsquo;t work. A vegetarian race is,
      generally speaking, small of stature and build, and less efficient than a
      meat-eating race. The rule of eating is solid food, sound food, plenty of
      it, and a good variety. Give your stomach a fair chance: don&rsquo;t
      overload it, don&rsquo;t understock it, and don&rsquo;t let it get bored.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Miss Bettina had been conducting a quiet and strategic
      advance upon the Health Master, and now by a sudden onslaught she captured
      his knee and, perching herself thereon, put a soft and chubby hand under
      his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want something, Miss Toodles,&rdquo; he accused with a
      formidable frown. &ldquo;None of your wheedling ways with me! Out with it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Candy,&rdquo; said the child, in no way impressed by his severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Candy, indeed! When?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now. Any time. Lots of it. Lots of sugar, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s developing <i>such</i> a sweet tooth!&rdquo; mourned
      her mother. &ldquo;I have to limit her rigidly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t let the child stuff herself on sweets all the
      time,&rdquo; protested Grandma Sharpless, scandalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor on anything else. But if she craves sweets, why not let her
      have them at the proper time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in my day children ate plain food and were thankful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! I&rsquo;m a little dubious about the thankfulness. And in your
      day children died more frequently and more easily than in ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t pampered to death on candy, anyway!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly they weren&rsquo;t pampered quite enough. Take the Cherub,
      here,&rdquo; he tossed Betty in the air and whisked her to his shoulder.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a perfect little bundle of energy, always in motion.
      She needs energy-producing food to keep going, coal for that engine. Sugar
      is almost pure carbon; that is, coal in digestible form. Of course she
      wants sweets. Her little body is logical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it bad for her teeth?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nor for her last year&rsquo;s overshoes or her tin dog&rsquo;s
      left hind leg,&rdquo; chuckled the Health Master. &ldquo;Sometimes I
      marvel that the race has survived all the superstitions surrounding food
      and drink.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my father&rsquo;s household,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;the
      family principle was never to drink anything with meals. The mixture of
      solids and liquids was held to be bad. Another superstition, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that rate, bread and milk would be rank poison,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Strong. &ldquo;Next to food, water has got the finest incrustation of
      old-wives&rsquo; warnings. Now, there&rsquo;s some doubt whether a man
      should eat whenever he wants to. Appetite, in the highly nervous American
      organization, is sometimes tricky. But thirst is trustworthy. The normal
      man is perfectly safe in drinking all the water he wants whenever he wants
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can still remember the agonies that I suffered when, as a boy, I
      had scarlet fever, and they would allow me almost no water,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of medicine&rsquo;s direst errors,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
      &ldquo;Nobody will ever know how much that false and cruel system has
      added to our death-rate in the past. To-day a practitioner who kept water
      from a fever patient&mdash;unless there were unusual complications&mdash;would
      be properly citable for malpractice. By the way,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;re changing our views about feeding in long illnesses.
      Typhoid patients have always been kept down to the lowest possible diet,
      nothing but milk. Now, some of the big hospitals are feeding typhoid
      cases, right through the fever, on foods carefully selected for their heat
      and energy values, with the result that not only has the patient more
      strength to fight the disease, but he pulls through practically free from
      the emaciation which has always been regarded as inevitable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I have my candy?&rdquo; inquired Bettina, holding to her own
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s good, sound candy. Now I&rsquo;m going to utter an
      awful heresy. Generally speaking, and in moderation, what you want is good
      for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pure anarchy,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; the law of the body, always demanding what is best for
      its development.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want,&rdquo; declared Robin, with a sudden energy, &ldquo;to
      take off these hot, scratchy flannels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late now,&rdquo; said the Health Master, &ldquo;until spring.
      You&rsquo;ve been wearing them all winter. But another year, if I have my
      way, you won&rsquo;t have to put them on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d let him tempt pneumonia by going through a winter with
      light summer underwear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you get out an injunction against me,&rdquo; smiled the
      physician. &ldquo;Bobs had a pretty tough time of it for the first week
      when he changed to flannels. He&rsquo;s thin-skinned, and the rough wool
      irritated him pretty badly. In fact, he had a slight fever for two days.
      It isn&rsquo;t worth that suffering. Besides, he&rsquo;s a full-blooded
      youngster, and doesn&rsquo;t need the extra warmth. You can&rsquo;t dress
      all children alike in material any more than you can dress them all from
      the same pattern.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I want to leave off mine, too,&rdquo; announced Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! You little ruffian, you could wear sandpaper on that skin
      of yours. Don&rsquo;t talk to me, or next time I see you without your
      overcoat I&rsquo;ll order a hair shirt for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought much about the children&rsquo;s clothes,
      except to change between the seasons,&rdquo; confessed Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;I
      supposed that was all there is to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wholly. I once knew a man who died from changing his necktie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he put on a red tie with a pink shirt?&rdquo; interestedly
      queried Manny, who had reached the age where attire was becoming a vital
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He changed abruptly from the big puff-tie which he had worn all
      winter, and which was a regular chest-protector, to a skimpy bow, thereby
      exposing a weak chest and getting pneumonia quite naturally. Yet he was
      ordinarily a cautious old gentleman, and shifted the weight of his
      underclothes by the calendar&mdash;a rather stupid thing to do, by the
      way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the first of November,&rdquo; began Grandma Sharpless severely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; cut in the Health Master. &ldquo;Your whole
      family went into flannels whether the thermometer was twenty or seventy.
      And we&rsquo;ve seen it both, more than once on that date.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What harm did it ever do them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bodily discomfort. In other words, lessened vitality. Think how
      much nervous wear is suffered by a child itching and squirming in a
      scratchy suit of heavy flannels on a warm day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children can&rsquo;t be changing from one weight to another every
      day, can they?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need of that. But in the fall and spring we can regulate that
      matter a little more by the thermometer, and a little less by the almanac.
      There is also the consideration of controlling heat. Now, Charley, what
      would you think of a man who, in June, say, with the mercury at
      seventy-five, wandered around in a heavy suit and his winter flannels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think he was sick,&rdquo; said the nine-year-old
      promptly, &ldquo;or else foolish. But what makes you ask me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just by way of calling your attention to the thermometer, which in
      this room stands at seventy-nine. And here we all sit, dressed twenty-five
      per cent warmer than if we were out doors in a June temperature several
      degrees colder. You&rsquo;re the Committee on Air and Light, Charley. I
      think this matter of heat ought to come within your province.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it makes you feel so cold when you go out,&rdquo; said Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. We Americans live in one of the most trying climates in
      the world, and we add to its rigors by heating our houses like incubators.
      No room over seventy, ought to be the rule.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to work in a cold room,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when you&rsquo;re used to it. The Chicago schools that have
      started winter roof classes for sickly children, find that the average of
      learning capacity goes up markedly in the cold, clean air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they can&rsquo;t be as comfortable,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much more so. As soon as the children get used to it, they love it,
      and they object strenuously to going back into the close rooms. The body
      grasps and assimilates the truth; the mind responds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I like to be comfortable as well as anybody,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Sharpless, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t consider it the chief end of life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the chief end,&rdquo; assented Dr. Strong; &ldquo;the chief
      means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comfort and health,&rdquo; mused Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;It seems a
      natural combination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most natural in the world. Let me put it into an allegory.
      Health is the main line, the broad line, the easy line. It&rsquo;s the
      simple line to travel, because comfort keeps pointing it out. Essentially
      it is the line of the least resistance. The trouble with most of us is we&rsquo;re
      always unconsciously taking transfers to the cross-lines. The transfer may
      be Carelessness, or Slothfulness, or Gluttony, or one of the Dissipations
      in food, drink, work or play; or it may be even Egotism, which is
      sometimes a poison: but they all take you to Sick Street. Don&rsquo;t get
      a transfer down Sick Street. The road is rough, the scenery dismal, and at
      the end is the cemetery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of all roads,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then in Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said the Health Master, &ldquo;let
      us take the longest and sunniest route and sing as we go!&rdquo;

      XI. THE BESIEGED CITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Bettina falls the credit of setting the match to the train. That
      lively-minded young lady had possessed herself of a large, red square of
      cardboard, upon which, in the midst of the Clyde family circle, she
      wrought mightily with a paint-brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What comes after p in &lsquo;diphtheria,&rsquo; Charley?&rdquo; she
      presently appealed to her next older brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley considered the matter with head aslant. &ldquo;Another p,&rdquo;
      he answered, tactfully postponing the evil moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look right,&rdquo; announced the Cherub, after a
      moment&rsquo;s contemplation. &ldquo;Dr. Strong, how do you spell &lsquo;diphtheria&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Why, Toots, I spell it with a capital, but leave off the final
      x,&rdquo; replied the Health Master cheerfully. &ldquo;What kind of a game
      are you playing? Quarantining your dolls?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a game.&rdquo; Betty could be, on occasion, quite a
      self-contained young person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then, if I&rsquo;m not prying too far into personal
      matters?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Eula Simms to put on her house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Simmses <i>will</i> be pleased,&rdquo; remarked Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to be,&rdquo; said Betty complacently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      suppose they can afford a regular one like the one we put up when Charley
      had scarlet fever, two years ago. And Eula&rsquo;s big sister&rsquo;s got
      diphtheria,&rdquo; she added quite casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; The Health Master straightened up sharply
      in his chair. &ldquo;How do you know that, Twinkles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eula told me across the fence this morning. She&rsquo;s excused
      from school. Three other houses on the street have got it, too. I&rsquo;m
      going to make placards for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do the work in play that the Health Department ought to be
      doing in the deadliest earnest! What on earth is Dr. Merritt thinking of?&rdquo;
      And he went to the telephone to call up the Health Officer and find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re due for a bad diphtheria year, too,&rdquo; observed
      Grandma Sharpless, whose commentaries on practical matters, being always
      the boiled-down essence of first-hand observation, carried weight in the
      household. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that it swings around about once in
      every five or six years. And it was six years ago we had that bad
      epidemic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is the influenza epidemic of last spring to consider,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Dr. Strong told us then that we&rsquo;d have to
      pay for that for months. So, I suppose, the city is still in a weakened
      condition and easy soil for diphtheria or any other epidemic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s measles already in our school,&rdquo; said Julia.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll help, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you reported it, Junkum?&rdquo; asked her father.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Chairman of the Committee on School Conditions of the
      Clyde Household Protective Association.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We only found out to-day,&rdquo; said Bobs, &ldquo;when they told
      us maybe school would close.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years I&rsquo;ve been President of the Public Health League,&rdquo;
      remarked Mr. Clyde with a wry face, &ldquo;and nothing has happened. Now
      that I&rsquo;m just about retiring I hope there isn&rsquo;t going to be
      serious trouble. What does the Health Department say, Strong?&rdquo; he
      inquired, turning as the Health Master entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something very wrong there. Merritt won&rsquo;t talk over the
      &lsquo;phone. Wants me to come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s ill, himself, and badly worried. What do <i>you</i>
      think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like some skullduggery,&rdquo; declared Mr. Clyde,
      borrowing one of his mother-in-law&rsquo;s expressive words. &ldquo;Is it
      possible that reports of diphtheria are being suppressed, and that is why
      the infected houses are not placarded?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is, we&rsquo;re in for trouble. As I told you, when I
      undertook the Chinese job of keeping this household in health,&rdquo;
      continued the Health Master, addressing the family, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      reliably protect a family in a community which doesn&rsquo;t protect
      itself. There are too many loopholes through which infection may
      penetrate. So the Protective Association, in self-defense, may have to
      spur up the city to its own defense. First, though, I&rsquo;m going over
      the throats of this family and take cultures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; began the mother anxiously, &ldquo;that
      the children&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve got it. But the
      bacteriological analysis will show.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to have it done,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde, shuddering. &ldquo;It
      seems so&mdash;so inviting of trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superstition,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong, smiling. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
      you just as anxious to find out that they <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> got the
      infection as that they have? Come on, Bettykin; you&rsquo;re first.&rdquo;
      And, having prepared his material, he swabbed the throats of the whole
      company, after which he took the cultures with him to Dr. Merritt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when he returned, but he went direct to Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than I thought, Clyde,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      in the first stage of a bad epidemic. The reports have been suppressed by
      Mullins, the Deputy Health Officer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do that for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To cover his own inefficiency. He is City Bacteriologist, also, and
      the law requires him, in time of epidemic, to make bacteriological
      analyses. He doesn&rsquo;t know how. So he simply pigeonholed the case
      reports as they came in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did such a rascal ever get the job?&rdquo; asked Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Political pull. The most destructive of all the causes of death
      which never get into the mortality records,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many cases?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or four hundred, at least. It&rsquo;s got a good start. And
      more than that of measles. While he was in the business of suppressing,
      Mullins threw a lot of measles reports aside, too. I don&rsquo;t like the
      prospect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first thing to do,&rdquo; decided Mr. Clyde, with customary
      energy, &ldquo;is to get Dr. Mullins out. I&rsquo;ll call an emergency
      meeting of the Public Health League to-morrow. By the way, Julia has some
      matters to report from school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose we call an emergency meeting of our own of the
      Household Protective Association for to-morrow evening,&rdquo; suggested
      Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re facing an epidemic, we may as well
      fortify the youngsters as soundly as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly after dinner on the following evening the Association was called
      to order by Mr. Clyde, presiding. It was a full meeting except for
      Maynard, who had not returned for dinner. First Dr. Strong reported that
      the cultures from the throats of the family had turned out &ldquo;negative.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we don&rsquo;t have to worry about that,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Mrs. Clyde and her mother drew long breaths of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for the Committee on School Conditions,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve heard of in our school is measles,&rdquo; announced
      Julia. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of the boys and girls away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No diphtheria?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked Miss Brown that at recess, and she looked queer and said,
      &lsquo;None that we know of.&rsquo; But I heard of some cases in the
      Academy; so I told Manny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Manny?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Chairman of the Committee on Milk, and the Bliss
      children from our dairy go to the Academy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That explains why Maynard isn&rsquo;t here, then,&rdquo; said the
      grandmother. &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s gone out to the farm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He took the interurban trolley out, to make sure that they&rsquo;d
      be careful about keeping the children away from the dairy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good team-work, Junkum,&rdquo; approved the presiding officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I asked Mary and Jim Bliss to come around to-morrow to see Dr.
      Strong and have him look at their throats.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be drawing a salary from the city, young lady,&rdquo;
      said the Health Master warmly. &ldquo;You may have stopped a milk-route
      infection; one of the hardest kind to trace down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re talking of closing school after to-morrow,&rdquo;
      concluded the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very worst thing they could do,&rdquo; declared Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best, I should think,&rdquo; controverted Grandma
      Sharpless, who never hesitated to take issue with any authority, pending
      elucidation of the question under discussion. &ldquo;If you group a lot of
      children close together it stands to reason they&rsquo;ll catch the
      disease from each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you group them too close. Arm&rsquo;s length is the
      striking distance of a contagious disease. <i>There&rsquo;s</i> a truth
      for all of us to remember all the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it <i>is</i> a truth,&rdquo; challenged Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;One
      of the surest and one of the most important,&rdquo; averred the Health
      Master. &ldquo;The only substance that carries the contagion of diphtheria
      or measles is the mucus from the nose or throat of an infected person. As
      far as that can be coughed or sneezed is the danger area. Of course, any
      article contaminated with it is dangerous also. But a hygienically
      conducted schoolroom is as safe a place as could be found. I&rsquo;d like
      to run a school in time of epidemic. I&rsquo;d make it a distributing
      agency for health instead of disease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you manage that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By controlling and training the pupils hygienically. Don&rsquo;t
      you see that school attendance offers the one best chance of keeping track
      of such an epidemic, among the very ones who are most liable to it, the
      children? Diphtheria is contagious in the early stages, as soon as the
      throat begins to get sore, and before the patient is really ill. Just now
      there is an indeterminate number of children in every one of our schools
      who have incipient diphtheria. What is the one important thing to do about
      them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find out who they are,&rdquo; said Julia quickly. &ldquo;Exactly.
      If you close school to-morrow and scatter the scholars far and wide in
      their homes, how are we going to find out this essential fact? In their
      own homes, with no one to watch their physical condition, they will go on
      developing the illness unsuspected for days, maybe, and spread it about
      them in the process of development. Whereas, if we keep them in school
      under a system of constant inspection, we shall discover these cases and
      surround them with safeguards. Why, if a fireman should throw dynamite
      into a burning house and scatter the flaming material over several blocks,
      he&rsquo;d be locked up as insane. Yet here we propose to scatter the fire
      of contagion throughout the city. It&rsquo;s criminal idiocy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could only be sure of controlling it in the schools,&rdquo;
      said Grandma Sharpless, still doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least we can do much toward it. As a matter of fact the best
      authorities are very doubtful whether diphtheria is a &lsquo;school
      disease,&rsquo; anyway. There is more evidence, though not conclusive,
      that measles is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely we don&rsquo;t have to consider measles now, in the face of
      the greater danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most emphatically we do. For one thing, it will increase the
      diphtheria rate. A child weakened by measles is so much the more liable to
      catch any other disease which may be rife. Besides, measles spreads so
      rapidly that it often kills a greater total than more dangerous illnesses.
      We must prepare for a double warfare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Public Health League meeting,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, &ldquo;the
      objections to closing the schools came from those who feared that an
      official acknowledgment that the city had an epidemic would hurt business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A viciously wrong reason for being right,&rdquo; said the Health
      Master. &ldquo;By the way, I suppose that Dr. Mullins will be Acting
      Health Officer, now that Merritt is unfortunately out of it. Merritt went
      to the hospital in collapse after the session of the Board of Education at
      which he appeared, to argue for keeping the schools open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Clyde. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve blocked Mullins off. But
      it&rsquo;s the next step that is troubling me. What would you do, Strong,
      if you were in control?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put a medical inspector in every school,&rdquo; answered Dr. Strong
      instantly. &ldquo;Send home every child with the snuffles or an inflamed
      throat. And send with him full warning and instructions to the parents.
      Have daily inspection and instruction of all pupils.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you make school children understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It is merely a matter of telling them repeatedly: &lsquo;Keep
      your fingers and other objects away from your mouth and nose. Wash your
      hands frequently. Brush your teeth and rinse your mouth well. And keep
      your distance. Remember, that the striking distance of disease is arm&rsquo;s
      length.&rsquo; Then I would break class every hour, throw open every
      window, and march the children around for five minutes. This for the sake
      of improved general condition. Penalize the pupils for any violation of
      hygienic regulations. Hygienic martial law for war-time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; applauded Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;So much for the schools.
      What about the general public?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Educate them to the necessity of watching for danger signals; the
      running nose, the sore throat, the tiny pimples on the inside of the mouth
      or cheek which are the first sign of measles. Above all, furnish free
      anti-toxin. Make it free to all. This is no time to be higgling over
      pennies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the principle of coddling our citizens by giving
      to those who can afford to pay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better coddled citizens than dead children. Unless you give out
      free anti-toxin, physicians to families where every dollar counts will
      say, &lsquo;Oh, it may not be diphtheria. We&rsquo;ll wait and see, and maybe
      save the extra dollars.&rsquo; Diphtheria doesn&rsquo;t wait. It strikes.
      Then there is the vitally important use of anti-toxin as a preventive. To
      render a whole family immune, where there is exposure from a known case of
      diphtheria, is expensive at the present rates, but is the most valuable
      expedient known. It is so much easier to prevent than to cure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I give in. What else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Education, education, education; always education of the public,
      till the last flame is stamped out. Get the press, first; that is the most
      direct and far-reaching agency. Then organize public meetings, lectures,
      addresses in churches and Sunday schools, talks wherever you can get
      people together to listen. That is what I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead and do it, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily said,&rdquo; smiled the Health Master. &ldquo;Who am I, to
      practice what I preach?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provisional Health Officer of Worthington,&rdquo; came the quick
      answer. &ldquo;I have the Mayor&rsquo;s assurance that he will appoint you
      to-morrow if you will take the job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said the Health Master, blinking a little
      with the suddenness of the announcement, but speaking unhesitatingly,
      &ldquo;on two conditions: open schools and free anti-toxin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get that arranged with the Mayor. Meantime, you have
      unlimited leave of absence as Chinese physician to the Clyde household.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Household Protective Association will have to back me,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong, as the meeting broke up. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get along
      without you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly and terribly moves an epidemic, once it has gained headway. And
      silence and concealment had fostered this onset from the first. Despite
      the best efforts of the new Health Officer, within a week the streets of
      the city were abloom with the malign flower of the scarlet for diphtheria
      and the yellow for measles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First we must find out where we stand,&rdquo; Dr. Strong told his
      subordinates; and, enlisting the services of the great body of physicians,&mdash;there
      is no other class of men so trained and inspired to altruistic public
      service as the medical profession,&mdash;he instituted a house-to-house
      search for hidden or undiscovered cases. From the best among his
      volunteers he chose a body of auxiliary school inspectors, one for every
      school, whom he held to their daily régime with military rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my patients are dying while I am looking after a roomful of
      healthy children,&rdquo; objected one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can save twenty lives by early detection of the disease, in the
      time it takes to save one by treatment,&rdquo; retorted the
      disciplinarian. &ldquo;In war the individual must sometimes be sacrificed.
      And this is war.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The one bright spot in the early days of the battle was Public School
      Number Three which the twins and Bettina attended. The medical inspector
      who had this assignment was young, intelligent, and an enthusiast. Backed
      by Dr. Strong, and effectively aided by the Clyde children, he enforced a
      system which brought prompt results. In every instance where a pupil was
      sent home under suspicion,&mdash;and the first day&rsquo;s inspection
      brought to light three cases of incipient diphtheria, and fifteen which
      developed into measles, besides a score of suspicious symptoms,&mdash;Julia,
      or Robin Clyde, or one of the teachers went along to deliver printed
      instructions as to the defense of the household, and to explain to the
      family the vital necessity of heeding the regulations until such time as
      the physician could come and determine the nature of the ailment. Within a
      week, amidst growing panic and peril, Number Three was standing like an
      isle of safety. After that time, not a single new case of either disease
      developed from exposure within its limits, and in only two families
      represented in the school was there any spread of contagion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the following-up into the house that does it,&rdquo;
      said Dr. Strong, at an early morning meeting of the Household Protective
      Association (he still insisted on occasional short sessions, in spite of
      the overwhelming demands on his time and energies, on the ground that
      these were &ldquo;the only chances I get to feel the support of full
      understanding and sympathy&rdquo;), &ldquo;that and the checking-up of the
      three carriers we found.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a carrier?&rdquo; asked Bettina, who had an
      unquenchable thirst for finding out things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A carrier, Toodlekins, is a perfectly well person who has the germs
      of disease in his throat. Why he doesn&rsquo;t fall ill himself, we don&rsquo;t
      know. He can give the disease to another person just as well as if he were
      in the worst stages of it himself. Every epidemic develops a number of
      carriers. One of the greatest arguments for inspection is that it brings
      to light these people, who constitute the most difficult and dangerous
      phase of infection, because they go on spreading the disease without being
      suspected. Now, I&rsquo;ve got ours from Number Three quarantined. If I
      could catch every carrier in town, I&rsquo;d guarantee to be in control of
      the situation in three weeks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our reports show over twenty of them discovered and isolated,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Clyde, who had turned her abounding energies to the organization
      of a corps of visiting nurses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better say something about carriers in my next
      talk,&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless, whose natural gift as a ready and
      convincing speaker, unsuspected by herself as well as her family until the
      night when she had met and routed the itinerating quack on his own
      platform, was now being turned to account in the campaign for short talks
      before Sunday schools and club gatherings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Develop it as part of the arm&rsquo;s-length idea,&rdquo; suggested
      the Health Master. &ldquo;Any person may be a carrier and therefore a
      peril on too close contact. Tell &lsquo;em that in words of one syllable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never use any other kind when I mean it,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
      Sharpless. &ldquo;What about that party at Mrs. Ellery&rsquo;s, Manny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that fixed,&rdquo; replied Maynard Clyde, who had
      been acting as general factotum for the household in its various lines of
      endeavor. &ldquo;Mrs. Ellery gave a party to our crowd Friday night,&rdquo;
      he explained to Dr. Strong, &ldquo;and Monday one of the Ellery girls came
      down with diphtheria.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done about it?&rdquo; asked the Health Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notified all the people who were there. That was easy. The trouble
      is that a lot of the fellows have gone back to college since: to Hamilton,
      Michigan, Wisconsin, Harvard, Columbia,&mdash;I suppose there were a dozen
      colleges represented.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that&rsquo;s too wide a field for the follow-up
      system?&rdquo; asked his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said the boy thoughtfully. &ldquo;I figured that
      starting a new epidemic would be worse than adding to an old one. So I
      went to Mrs. Ellery and got a list of her guests, and I wrote to every
      college the fellows have gone back to, and wrote to the fellows
      themselves. They probably won&rsquo;t thank me for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to give you a life-saving medal each,&rdquo; declared
      Dr. Strong. &ldquo;As for the situation here&rdquo;&mdash;his face
      darkened&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;re not making any general headway. The
      public isn&rsquo;t aroused, and it won&rsquo;t be until we can get the
      newspapers to take up the fight. The thing that discourages me is that
      they won&rsquo;t help. I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? I do,&rdquo; said Clyde grimly. &ldquo;Their
      advertisers won&rsquo;t let &lsquo;em print anything about it. As I told
      you in the matter of closing the schools, business is frightened. The
      department stores, theaters, and other big advertisers are afraid that the
      truth about the epidemic would scare away trade. So they are compelling
      the papers to keep quiet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiots!&rdquo; cried Dr. Strong. &ldquo;Suppressing news is like
      suppressing gas. The longer you do it, the more violent the inevitable
      explosion. But when I called on the editors, they didn&rsquo;t say
      anything to me about the advertising pressure. It was, &lsquo;We should be
      glad to help in any way, Dr. Strong. But an alarmist policy is not for the
      best interests of Worthington; and the good of our community must always
      be the first consideration.&rsquo;&mdash;Bah! The variations I&rsquo; ve
      heard on that sickening theme today! The &lsquo;Press,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Clarion,&rsquo;
      the &lsquo;Evening News,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Telegram, the &lsquo;Observer&rsquo;&mdash;all
      of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention the &lsquo;Star,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
      Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That rag? It&rsquo;s against everything decent and for everything
      rotten in this town,&rdquo; said Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I need a danger signal,&rdquo; observed the old lady with her
      most positive air, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wave any kind of rag. The &lsquo;Star&rsquo;
      has circulation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted the Health Master, &ldquo;and among the very
      class we want to reach. But what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
      going to find out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One hour later she walked into the editorial sanctum of Mr. &ldquo;Bart&rdquo;
      Snyder, editor, proprietor, and controlling mind of as &ldquo;yellow&rdquo;
      a sheet as ever subsisted on a combination of enterprise, real
      journalistic ability, and blackmail. Mr. Snyder sat in a perfect slump of
      apparent languor, his body sagging back into his tilted chair, one foot
      across his desk, the other trailing like a broken wing along the floor,
      his shrewd, lined face uplifted at an acute angle with the cigar he was
      chewing, and his green hat achieving the most rakish effect possible to a
      third slant. His brilliant gray eyes were narrowed into a hard twinkle as
      he surveyed his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Siddown,&rdquo; he grunted, and shoved a chair toward her with the
      grounded foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Sharpless did not &ldquo;siddown.&rdquo; Instead she marched over
      to a spot directly in front of him, halted, and looked straight into the
      hard, humorous face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bartholomew Snyder,&rdquo; said she crisply, &ldquo;I knew you when
      you were a boy. I knew your mother, too. She was a decent woman. Take off
      that hat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Snyder jaw fell so unpremeditatedly that the Snyder cigar dropped upon
      the littered floor. One third of a second later, the Snyder foot descended
      upon it (and it was a twenty-cent cigar, too) as the Snyder chair reverted
      to the perpendicular, and the Snyder hat came off. The Snyder countenance
      quivered into articulation and therefrom came a stunned, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll
      be&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t! Not in <i>my</i> presence,&rdquo; cut in his
      visitor. &ldquo;Now, you listen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; he assured her in a strangled murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself and threw a quality of rigidity into her backbone
      calculated to impress if not actually to appeal. &ldquo;I want your help,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, fat way you&rsquo;ve got of opening up a request for a favor,&rdquo;
      he retorted, recovering himself somewhat, and in a particularly
      discouraging voice. But the shrewd old judge of human nature before him
      marked the little pursing at the corners of the mouth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      bet I know what it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet all the money I&rsquo;ve got in the bank and my best
      gold tooth thrown in you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the prompt retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sporting proposition, all right,&rdquo; cried the
      editor in great admiration. &ldquo;I thought you was going to ask me to
      let up on the city administration now you&rsquo;ve got one of the fat jobs
      in the family, with your Dr. Strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing you don&rsquo;t have to make guesses for a
      living,&rdquo; returned his caller scornfully. &ldquo;Pitch into the
      administration as hard as you like. I don&rsquo;t care. All I want is for
      you to print the news about this diphtheria epidemic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; There was a profound sardonicism in the final
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think of it, it isn&rsquo;t. I want you to print some
      editorials, too, telling people how to take care of themselves while the
      disease is spreading.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you might do the same thing about the measles epidemic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harr-rr-rr!&rdquo; It was a singular growl, not wholly compounded
      of wrath and disgust. &ldquo;Doc Strong send you here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bite me. I believe you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you publish some articles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look-a-here, Mrs. Sharpless; the &lsquo;Star&rsquo; is a business
      proposition. Its business is to make money for me. That&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s
      here for. People say some pretty tough things about me and the paper.
      Well, we&rsquo;re pretty tough. We can stand &lsquo;em. Let &lsquo;em
      talk, so long as I get the circulation and the advertising and the cash.
      Now, you want me to print something for you. Come down to brass tacks;
      what is there in it for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chance to be of some real use to your city for once in your life,&rdquo;
      answered Grandma Sharpless mildly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart Snyder threw back his head and laughed immoderately. &ldquo;Say, I
      like you,&rdquo; he gurgled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got nerve. Me a good
      Samaritan! It&rsquo;s so rich, I&rsquo;m half a mind to go you, if it wasn&rsquo;t
      for losing the advertising. Wha&rsquo; d&rsquo; ye want me to say, anyway,
      just for curiosity and cussedness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just give the people plain talk,&rdquo; explained the visitor.
      &ldquo;Talk to &lsquo;em in your editorials as if you had &lsquo;em by the
      buttonhole. Say to them: &lsquo;Do you want to get diphtheria? Well, you
      don&rsquo;t need to. It&rsquo;s just as easy to avoid it as to have it.
      Are you anxious to have measles in your house? It&rsquo;s for you to
      decide. All you need is to take reasonable care against it. Infectious
      disease only kills foo&mdash;careless people.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it go at &lsquo;fools,&rsquo;&rdquo; interjected Mr. Snyder,
      smiting his thigh. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d give them simple, straight advice; tell them how to
      recognize the early symptoms; how and where to get anti-toxin. And I&rsquo;d
      scare &lsquo;em, too. I&rsquo;d tell &lsquo;em there are five thousand
      cases of the two diseases in town, and there will be ten thousand in a
      week unless something is done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Up rose the editor-proprietor, kicked over his own chair, whirled Mrs.
      Sharpless&rsquo;s chair with its human burden to the desk, thrust a pencil
      into her hand, and slapped down a pad before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write it,&rdquo; he adjured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Me?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sharpless, her astonishment momentarily
      overwhelming her grammar. &ldquo;Bless you, man! I&rsquo;m no writer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk it, then, and make your pencil take down the talk. I&rsquo;ll
      be back in a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That minute stretched to a good half-hour, during which period Grandma
      Sharpless talked to her pencil. When Mr. Snyder returned, he had with him
      a mournful-looking man who, he explained occultly, &ldquo;holds down our
      city desk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is our new Health Editor,&rdquo; chuckled Snyder, indicating
      Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;How many cases did you say there were in town, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand or more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The city editor whistled whisperingly. &ldquo;Where do you get that?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Dr. Strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s news,&rdquo; said the desk man. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      suppose it was half so bad. If only we dared print it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other paper in town dares,&rdquo; suggested the visitor
      insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes it all the more news,&rdquo; remarked Snyder. &ldquo;What if
      we played it up for a big feature, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advertisers,&rdquo; said the city editor significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &lsquo;em drop out. They&rsquo;ll come back quick enough, when
      we&rsquo;ve shown up one or two and told why they quit us. And think of
      the splash we can make! Only paper in the city that dares tell the truth.
      We&rsquo;ll rub that into our highly respectable rivals. I&rsquo;ll make
      you a proposition,&rdquo; he added, turning to his caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve hammered at Tom Clyde pretty hard. I don&rsquo;t
      cotton to that saintly, holier-than-thou reform bunch at all. Well, let
      Clyde come into the &lsquo;Star&rsquo; with a signed statement as
      President of the Public Health League, and we&rsquo;ll make it the basis
      of a campaign that will rip this town wide open for a couple of weeks. I&rsquo;d
      like to see him in my paper, after all the roasting we&rsquo;ve handed
      him.&rdquo; And the malicious face wrinkled into another grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve bought a bargain,&rdquo; stated Mrs. Sharpless.
      &ldquo;The statement will be ready to-night. And another from Dr. Strong
      for good measure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine business!&rdquo; ejaculated the &ldquo;Star&rsquo;s&rdquo;
      owner. &ldquo;Not open to a reasonable offer in the newspaper game, are
      you?&rdquo; he added, laughing. &ldquo;No? Well, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would there be any use in my seeing the editors of the other
      papers?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch them fall in line,&rdquo; was the grim response. &ldquo;Before
      we&rsquo;ve been out a day, they&rsquo;ll be tumbling over each other to
      make the dear, deluded public believe that they&rsquo;re the real pioneers
      in saving the city from the deadly germ.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here are my notes, if you can make anything out of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Notes?&rdquo; said the newspaper man, who had been glancing at
      the sheets over Mrs. Sharp-less&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah. Yes,
      of course. All right. Glad to have metcher,&rdquo; he added, politely
      ushering her to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send a reporter up for the
      statements at eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much, Bartholomew Snyder,&rdquo; said Grandma
      Sharpless, shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it! Thanks the other way. You&rsquo;ve given me a good
      tip in my own game. Watch me&mdash;us&mdash;wake &lsquo;em up to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the combined insistence of Grandma Sharpless and diplomacy of the
      Health Master overrode Mr. Clyde&rsquo;s angry objections to &ldquo;going
      into that filthy sheet&rdquo; when the matter was broached to him that
      evening. For the good of the cause he finally acceded. And next morning
      the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; was a sight! It blazed in red captions. It squirmed
      and wriggled with illustrations of alleged germs. It shrieked in
      stentorian headlines. If the city had been beset by all the dogs of war,
      it couldn&rsquo;t have blared more martial defiance against the enemy. It
      held its competitors up to infinite scorn and derision as mean-spirited
      shirks and cowards, and slathered itself with fulsome praises as the only
      original prop of truth and righteousness. And, as the centerpoint and core
      of all this, flaunted-the statement and signature of the Honorable Thomas
      Clyde, President of the Worthington Public Health League&mdash;with
      photograph. The face of Mr. Clyde, as he confronted this outrage upon his
      sensibilities at the breakfast table, was gloom itself until he turned to
      the editorial page. Then he emitted a whoop of glee. For there,
      double-leaded and double-headed was a Health Column, by &ldquo;Our Special
      Writer, Grandma Sharpless, the Wisest Woman in Worthington. She will
      contribute opinions and advice on the epidemic to the &lsquo;Star&rsquo;
      exclusively.&rdquo; (Mr. Snyder had taken a chance with this latter
      statement.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; gasped the old lady, when her son-in-law made
      known the cause of his mirth. Then, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve published that
      stuff of mine just as I wrote it. I didn&rsquo;t dream it was for print.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it so bully,&rdquo; said the Health Master.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the editorial trick of confidential, convincing,
      man-to-man talk down fine. What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll have to keep it
      up, now. Your friend, Snyder, has fairly caught you. Well, we need an
      official organ in the household.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Vowing that she couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t do it, nevertheless the
      new &ldquo;editor&rdquo; began to think of so many things that she wanted
      to say that, each day, when a messenger arrived from the &ldquo;Star&rdquo;
      with a polite request for &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; there was a telling column
      ready of the Health Master&rsquo;s wisdom, simplified and pointed by
      Grandma Sharpless&rsquo;s own pungent, crisp, vigorous, and homely style.
      Thanks largely to this, the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; became the mouthpiece of an
      anti-epidemic campaign which speedily enlisted the whole city.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; was not to have the field to itself. Once the
      cat was out of the bag, the other papers not only recognized it as a cat
      with great uproar, but, so to speak, proceeded to tie a can to its tail
      and pelt it through the streets of the city. As a matter of fact, no
      newspaper wishes to be hampered in the publishing of legitimate news; and
      it was only by the sternest threats of withdrawal of patronage that the
      large advertisers had hitherto succeeded in coercing the press of
      Worthington. Further coercion was useless, now that the facts had found
      their way into type. With great unanimity and an enthusiasm none the less
      genuine for having been repressed, the papers rushed into the breach. The
      &ldquo;Clarion&rdquo; organized an Anti-Infection League of School
      Children, with officers and banners. The &ldquo;Press&rdquo; &ldquo;attended
      to&rdquo; the recreant Dr. Mullins so fiercely that, notwithstanding his
      pull, he resigned his position in the Health Department because of &ldquo;breakdown
      due to overwork in the course of his duties,&rdquo; and ceased to trouble,
      in official circles. Enterprising reporters of the &ldquo;Observer&rdquo;
      caused the arrest of thirty-five trolley-car conductors for moistening
      transfers with a licked thumb, and then got the street-car company to
      issue a new form of transfer inscribed across the back, &ldquo;Keep me
      away from your Mouth.&rdquo; It fell to the &ldquo;Evening News&rdquo; to
      drive the common drinking-cup out of existence, after which it instituted
      reforms in soda fountains, restaurants, and barber shops, while the
      &ldquo;Telegram&rdquo; garnered great glory by interspersing the
      inning-by-inning returns of the baseball championship with bits of counsel
      as to how to avoid contagion in the theater, in the street, in travel, in
      banks, at home, and in various other walks of life. But the &ldquo;Star&rdquo;
      held foremost place, and clinched it with a Sunday &ldquo;cut-out&rdquo;
      to be worn as a badge, inscribed &ldquo;Hands Off, Please, Until It&rsquo;s
      Over.&rdquo; All of which, while it sometimes verged upon the absurd,
      served the fundamentally valuable purpose of keeping the public in mind of
      the peril of contact with infected persons or articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly but decisively the public absorbed the lesson. &ldquo;Arm&rsquo;s
      length&rdquo; became a catch-phrase; a motto; a slogan. People came slowly
      to comprehend the methods by which disease is spread and the principles of
      self-protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as knowledge widened, the epidemic ebbed, though gradually. Serious
      epidemics are not conquered or even perceptibly checked in a day. They are
      like floods; dam them in one place and they break through your defenses in
      another. Inexplicable outbreaks occur just when the tide seems to have
      turned. And when victory does come, it may not be ascribable to any
      specific achievement of the hygienic forces. The most that can be said is
      that the persevering combination of effort has at last made itself felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red placards began to disappear; many of them, alas! only after the
      sable symbol of death had appeared beneath them. Dr. Strong and his
      worn-out aides found time to draw breath and reckon up their accounts in
      human life. The early mortality had been terrific. Of the cases which had
      developed in the period of suppression, before antitoxin was readily
      obtainable, more than a third had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody will ever be indicted for those murders,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Strong to Mr. Clyde grimly. &ldquo;But we have the satisfaction of knowing
      what can really be done by prompt work. Look at the figures after the free
      anti-toxin was established.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a drop in the death rate, first to twenty per cent, then to ten,
      and, in the ebb stage of the scourge, to well below five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many infections we&rsquo;ve prevented by giving anti-toxin to
      immunize exposed persons, there&rsquo;s no telling,&rdquo; continued Dr.
      Strong. &ldquo;That principle of starting a back-fire in diphtheria,&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      exactly like starting a back-fire in a prairie conflagration,&mdash;by
      getting anti-toxin into the system in time to head off the poison of the
      disease itself, is one of the two or three great achievements of medical
      science. There isn&rsquo;t an infected household in the city today, I
      believe, where this hasn&rsquo;t been done. The end is in sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can go away and get a few days&rsquo; rest,&rdquo; said
      Grandma Sharpless, who constituted herself the Health Master&rsquo;s own
      health guardian and undiplomaed medical adviser, and to whom he habitually
      rendered meek obedience; for she had been watching with anxiety the
      haggard lines in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Measles we still have with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decreasing, though,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Our nurses
      report a heavy drop in new cases and a big crop of convalescents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is those convalescents that we must watch. I don&rsquo;t want a
      generation of deaf citizens growing up from this onset.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you prevent it if the disease attacks the ears?&rdquo;
      asked Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost certainly. We&rsquo;ve got to inspect every child who has or
      had measles in this epidemic, and, where the ear-drum is shiny and
      concave, we will puncture it, by a very simple operation, which saves
      serious trouble in ninety per cent of the cases, at least. But it means
      constant watchfulness, for often the infection progresses without pain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time your inspectors will watch for other
      after-effects, then,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. It&rsquo;s my own opinion that nearly all the serious
      diseases of the eye, ear, liver, kidney, heart, and so on in early middle
      age are the late remote effects of what we carelessly call the lesser
      diseases of childhood. It is only a theory as yet; though some day I think
      it will be proved. At any rate, we know that a serious and pretty definite
      percentage of all deafness follows measles; and we are going to carry this
      thing through far enough to prevent that sequel and to turn over a
      reasonably cleaned-up situation to Dr. Merritt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of danger, by the way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde,
      &ldquo;and will be back at his desk in a fortnight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; he&rsquo;ll have an easier job henceforth,&rdquo; prophesied
      Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got an enlightened city to watch over. And he
      can thank you for that, Strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can thank the Clyde family,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong with feeling.
      &ldquo;I could have done little without you back of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been interesting to extend the principles of our
      Household Protective Association to the larger world,&rdquo; smiled Clyde.
      &ldquo;Beyond our own city, too, in one case. Manny has had a letter from
      the Professor of Hygiene at Hamilton College, where he enters next year,
      thanking him on behalf of the faculty for his warning about young Hyland
      who was exposed to diphtheria at the Ellery party. He went back to
      Hamilton a few days after and was starting in to play basketball, which
      would have been decidedly dangerous for his team mates; but the
      authorities, after getting Manny&rsquo;s letter, kept him out of the
      gymnasium, and kept a watch on him. He developed the disease a week later;
      but there has been no infection from him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s direct result,&rdquo; approved Dr. Strong. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      what I call spreading the gospel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandma&rsquo;s our real revivalist, at that,&rdquo; said Julia.
      &ldquo;The children at Number Three pay more attention to her column than
      they do to what the teachers tell them. The principal told us that it was
      the greatest educational force for health that Worthington had ever known.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only reflected wisdom from you, young man,&rdquo; said Grandma
      Sharpless to the Health Master. &ldquo;Thank goodness, I&rsquo;m through
      with it. I&rsquo;m so sick of it that I can&rsquo;t look at writing
      materials without wanting to cut the ink bottle&rsquo;s throat with my
      penholder. Bart Snyder has let me off. What&rsquo;s more, he sent me a
      check for $250. Pretty handsome of him. But I&rsquo;m going to send it
      back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why waste good money, grandma?&rdquo; drawled Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have me keep it, would you, for doing that work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said anything about keeping it? But don&rsquo;t feed it back to
      Bart Snyder. Why not contribute it to the Public Health League? It&rsquo;s
      always got a handsome deficit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In graceful recognition of my having a son-inlaw as president of
      it, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not president any more. My term was up last night. They
      didn&rsquo;t honor me with a reelection,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, with a
      rather too obvious glumness, which, for once, escaped the sharp old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The slinkums!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;After all the time and work
      you&rsquo;ve given to it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the ex-incumbent philosophically, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      one comfort. They&rsquo;ve put a better man in my place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such a thing,&rdquo; declared his mother-in-law, with vehement
      partisanship. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t find one. Who was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you one guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it you, young man?&rdquo; queried she, fixing the Health Master
      with a baleful eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; a better man than I,&rdquo; he hastened to assure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the name of sakes, who, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde, grabbing the old lady by both shoulders
      and giving her a vigorous kiss. &ldquo;Unanimously elected amidst an
      uproar of enthusiasm, as the &lsquo;Star&rsquo; puts it. Here it is, on
      the first column of the front page.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in the history of the Clyde household, the senior
      member thereof gave way to an unbridled license of speech, in the presence
      of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I vum!&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless.

      XII. PLAIN TALK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;W</span>hat do you
      find so interesting in that paper, Strong?&rdquo; asked Mr. Thomas Clyde,
      from his place in the corner of the big living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was just finished in the Clyde household, and the elders were
      sitting about, enjoying the easy and intermittent talk which had become a
      feature of the day since the Health Master had joined the family. From
      outside, the play of lively voices, above the harmonized undertones of a
      strummed guitar, told how the children were employing the after-dinner
      hour. Dr. Strong let the evening paper drop on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that has set me thinking,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever give that restless mind of yours a vacation,
      young man?&rdquo; inquired Grandma Sharpless, looking up from her game of
      solitaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is good for it. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to share this
      problem, and thus relieve me of part of the responsibility.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go on, if you&rsquo;ve found anything exciting,&rdquo; besought
      Mrs. Clyde, glancing up with her swift, interrogating smile. &ldquo;The
      paper seemed unusually dull to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you didn&rsquo;t read quite deep enough into it, possibly.&rdquo;
      He raised the journal, folded it neatly to a half-page, and holding it
      before his eyes, began smoothly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far, far away, as far as your conscience will let you believe, in
      the Land of Parables&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;That &lsquo;Land
      of Parables&rsquo; sounds as if we were going to have some Improving
      Information.&rdquo; He regarded his friend and adviser with a twinkling
      eye. &ldquo;Ought the children to miss this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is for you to decide later,&rdquo; said the Health Master
      gravely. And he resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far, far away, as far as conscience will let you believe, in the
      Land of Parables, there once stood a prosperous and self-contented city.
      Men lived therein by rule and rote. Only what their fathers before them
      had believed and received did they believe and receive. &lsquo;As it hath
      been, so it is now and ever must and shall be,&rsquo; was the principle
      whereby their lives were governed. Therefore they endured, without hope as
      without complaint, the depredations of a hideous Monster who preyed upon
      them unceasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So loathsome was this Monster that the very thought of him was held
      to taint the soul. His name was sealed away from the common speech. Only
      the boldest men spoke of him, and then in paraphrases and by
      circumlocutions. Fouled, indeed, was the fame of the woman who dared so
      much as confess to a knowledge of his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From time to time the wise and strong men of the city banded
      together and sallied forth to drive back other creatures of prey as they
      pressed too hard upon the people. Not so with the Monster. Because of the
      ban of silence no plan could be mooted, no campaign formulated to check
      his inroads. So he grew great and ever greater, and his blood hunger
      fierce and ever more fierce, and his scarlet trail wound in and out among
      the homes of the people, manifest even to those eyes which most sedulously
      sought to blind themselves against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seldom did the Monster slay outright. But where his claws clutched
      or his fangs pierced, a slow venom crept through the veins, and life was
      corroded at its very wellsprings. Nor was this the worst. Once the blight
      fell upon one member of a household, it might corrupt, by hidden and
      subtle ways, the others and innocent, who knew not of the curse
      overhanging them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon the foolish, the reckless, and the erring the Monster most
      readily fastened himself. But man nor woman nor child was exempt.
      Necessity drove young girls, struggling and shuddering, into the Monster&rsquo;s
      very jaws. The purity of a child or of a Galahad could not always save
      from the serpent-stroke which sped from out the darkness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Strong,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      read this before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what is in it, if that is what you mean. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; hesitated the other, glancing toward his wife and
      her mother. &ldquo;Only, I suspect it isn&rsquo;t going to be pleasant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t pleasant. It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandma Sharpless laid down her cards. &ldquo;Let him go on, Tom,&rdquo;
      she said decisively. &ldquo;We have no ban of silence in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a nod from Clyde, the Health Master continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always the taboo of silence hedged the Monster about and protected
      him; and men secretly revolted against it, yet were restrained from speech
      by the fear of public dishonor. So, in time, he came to have a Scarlet
      Court of Shame, with his retinue of slaves, whose duty it was to procure
      victims for his insatiate appetite. But this service availed his servitors
      nothing in forbearance, for, sooner or later, his breath of fiery venom
      blasted and withered them, one and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One refuge only did the people seek against the Monster. At every
      doorpost of the city stood a veiled statue of the supposed Goddess and
      Protectress of the Household, worshiped under the name of <i>Modesty</i>,
      and to her the people appealed for succor and protection. Also they
      invoked her vengeance against such as spoke the name of the Monster, and
      bitter were the penalties wrought upon these in her name. Nevertheless
      there arose martyrs whose tongues could not be silenced by any fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One was a brave priest who stood in his pulpit unashamed and spoke
      the terrible truth of the Monster, bidding his hearers arise and band
      themselves together and strike a blow for their homes and their dear ones.
      But the people hurried forth in dread, and sought refuge before the Veiled
      Idol; and the priest&rsquo;s words rang hollow in the empty tabernacle;
      and his church was deserted and crumbled away in neglect, so that the
      fearful said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Behold the righteous wrath which follows the breaking of the
      prescribed silence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, a learned and pious physician and healer gathered the young
      men about him in the marketplace to give them solemn warning against the
      Monster and his scarlet slaves. But his words returned upon himself, and
      he was branded with shame as one who worshiped not the Veiled Goddess, and
      was presently driven forth from his own place into the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there came into the hall of the City Fathers a woman with
      disheveled hair and tear-worn cheeks, who beat upon her breast and cried:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Vengeance,
      O Wise and Great Ones! My son, my little son went to the public baths, and
      the venom of the Monster was upon the waters, and my son is blind forever.
      What will ye do, that others may not suffer my grief?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Wise and Great Ones spoke together and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Surely this woman is mad, that she thus fouls her lips.&rsquo;
      And they drove her out of their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From among their own number there came a terror and a portent. For
      their Leader, who had been stricken in youth, but thought himself to have
      thrown off the toils of the Monster, rose in his place and spoke in a
      voice that piped and shook:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Because no man taught me in my unripe days, I strayed into
      the paths of the Scarlet One. For the space of a generation I hoped; but
      now the clutch is upon me again, and I die. See to it, O my Fellows, that
      our youth no longer perish in their ignorance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he passed out from the place of honor; and the strength of his
      mind and his body was loosened until he died. But, rather than violate the
      taboo, the Wise and Great Ones gave a false name to his death, and he was
      buried under a graven lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally there came to the Council Hall one with the fire of
      martyrdom in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Though I perish,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I and mine, yet will
      I speak the truth for once. My daughter I have given in marriage, and the
      Monster has entered into the house of her marriage, and from henceforth
      she must go, a maimed creature, sexless and childless, to the end of her
      days. Shame upon this city, that it endures such shame; for my daughter is
      but one of many.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The shame be yours,&rsquo; replied the Fathers, &lsquo;that
      you bring scandal upon your own. Go forth into exile, in the name of the
      Veiled Goddess, <i>Modesty</i>, beneath whose statue we meet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the man strode forward, and with a violent hand plucked the
      veil from the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not the Protectress of Homes,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;but
      the ally of the Monster. Not the Goddess, <i>Modesty</i>, but her sham
      sister, <i>Prudery</i>. Down with false gods!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So saying, he threw the idol to the ground, where it was shattered
      into a thousand pieces. With those pieces the Fathers stoned him to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in many households that night there was a baring of the Veiled
      Idol. And ever, behind the folds, was revealed not the pure gaze of the
      True Goddess, but the simper and leer of <i>Prudery</i>, mute accomplice
      of <i>Shame</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus did the city awake. Fearfully it gathered its forces;
      tremblingly it prepared its war upon the Monster. But the Monster is
      intrenched. Its venom runs through the blood of the people, poisoning it
      from generation to generation, so that neither the grandsons nor the
      great-grandsons of those who stoned the martyr to the False Goddess shall
      escape the curse. The Prophet has said it: &lsquo;Even unto the third and
      the fourth generations.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>De te fabula narratur</i>; of you is the fable narrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Land of Parables is your country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stricken city is your city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Monster coils at your doorway, lying in wait for your loved
      ones; and no prudence, no precaution, no virtue can guard them safely
      against his venom so long as the Silence of Prudery holds sway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strong let the newspaper fall on his lap, and looked slowly from face
      to face of the silent little group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need I tell you the name of the destroyer?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde in a low tone. &ldquo;It is a
      two-headed monster, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Health Master nodded. &ldquo;And because we all fear to utter the
      words &lsquo;venereal disease,&rsquo; our children grow up in the peril of the
      Monster whose two allies are Vice and Ignorance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One editor in this town, at least, has some gumption,&rdquo;
      commented Grandma Sharpless, peering over her spectacles at the sheet
      which Dr. Strong had let fall. &ldquo;Which paper is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, if you must know. The fact is, I read that allegory into the
      newspaper, not out of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was your own?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Such as it
      is, mine own. But the inspiration came from this headline.&rdquo; He
      pointed to a legend in heavy type:&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      DIVORCE IN THE INSIDE SET
    </h3>
    <h3>
      AFTER SEX MONTHS OF MARRIAGE, MRS. BARTLEY STARR
    </h3>
    <h3>
      SEEKS FREEDOM&mdash;NATURE OF CHARGES NOT MADE PUBLIC
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what is back of it, Strong?&rdquo; asked Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ruin of a life. Bartley Starr has been a &lsquo;rounder.&rsquo;
      With the curse of his vices upon him he married a young and untaught girl.&rdquo;
      He repeated with slow significance a passage from the allegory. &ldquo;The
      Monster entered into the house of her marriage, and from henceforth she
      must go, a maimed creature, sexless and childless, to the end of her days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; burst out Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Not poor little,
      lovely, innocent Margaret Starr!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too innocent,&rdquo; retorted the Health Master. &ldquo;And more
      than innocent; ignorant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Bartley Starr!&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Who would have
      supposed him such a scoundrel? And with his bringing-up, too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The explanation lies in his bringing-up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Henry Starr is as upright a man and as good a father as
      you can find in Worthington.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The former, perhaps. Not the latter, certainly. He is a worshiper
      of the False Veiled Goddess, I suspect. Hence Bartley&rsquo;s tragedy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you blame Bartley&rsquo;s viciousness upon his father?&rdquo;
      demanded Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In part, at least. I happen to know a good deal about this case.
      Bartley got his sex-education or miseducation from chance talk at school.
      He took that to college with him, and there, unguided, fell into vicious
      ways. I don&rsquo;t suppose his father ever had a frank talk with him in
      his life. And I judge that little Mrs. Starr&rsquo;s mother never had one
      with her, either. Look at the result!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But boys find out about such things some way,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde
      uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some way? What way? And from whom? How much has Manny found out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Manny&rsquo;s father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; persisted the Health Master
      relentlessly. &ldquo;You are his father, and, what is more, his friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why must Manny know?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Clyde. &ldquo;Surely my son
      isn&rsquo;t going to wallow in that sort of foulness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray God he is not!&rdquo; said Grandma Sharpless, turning her old,
      shrewd, kind face, the eyes bright and soft with feeling, toward her
      daughter. &ldquo;But, oh, my dear, my dear, the bitterest lesson we
      mothers have to learn is that our children are of the common flesh and
      blood of humanity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manny is clean-minded and high-spirited,&rdquo; said Strong.
      &ldquo;But not all of his companions are. Not a month ago I heard one of
      the older boys in his class assuring some of his fellows, in the terms of
      the most damnable lie that ever helped to corrupt youth, &lsquo;Why, it
      ain&rsquo;t any worse than an ordinary cold.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a stock phrase of the young toughs when I was a boy,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;So it still persists, does it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any worse than an ordinary cold?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Clyde,
      looking puzzled. &ldquo;What did he mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gonorrhoea,&rdquo; said Dr. Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clyde winced back and half-rose from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; asked the Health Master rather &lsquo;grimly.
      &ldquo;Must I be mealy-mouthed on this subject? Here I am, trying to tell
      you something of the most deadly import, and am I to choose perfumed words
      and pick rose-tinted phrases?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out, Strong,&rdquo; said the head of the house. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been rather expecting this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, then: you need not worry about Manny. I talked to him, long
      ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s only a boy, still,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless
      involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He enters college this fall. And I&rsquo;ve made sure that he won&rsquo;t
      take with him the &lsquo;no worse than a cold&rsquo; superstition about a
      disease which has wrecked the lives of thousands of Bartley Starrs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought that Starr&rsquo;s was the&mdash;the other and worse
      form,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plain talk,&rdquo; adjured the Health Master. &ldquo;You thought it
      was syphilis?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you thought syphilis worse than gonorrhoea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll explain that in detail presently.
      Just now&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I have to hear all of this,&rdquo; appealed Mrs. Clyde, with a
      face of piteous disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> told Manny,&rdquo; said the Health Master in
      measured tones. &ldquo;Must I be the one to tell Julia, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia!&rdquo; cried the mother. &ldquo;Tell Julia?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one must tell her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That child?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen years old, and in high school. Last year there were ten
      known cases of venereal disease among the high-school girls.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  These and the following instances are based on actual and
     established medical findings.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad enough. I have known worse elsewhere. In a certain small city
      school, several years ago, it was discovered that there was an epidemic of
      vice which involved practically the whole school. And it was discovered
      only when venereal disease broke out. Our school authorities are just
      beginning to learn that immorality must be combated by watchfulness and
      quarantine, just as contagious disease must.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was the outbreak in our high school found out?&rdquo; asked
      Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a curious and tragic way. One of the boys developed a sudden and
      serious inflammation of the eyes. At first the ophthalmologist to whom he
      went was puzzled. Then he began to suspect. A bateriological analysis
      showed that it was a case of gonorrhoeal infection. It was by a hair&rsquo;s
      breadth that the less infected eye was saved. The sight of the other is
      lost. Examination showed that the disease was confined to the eyes. By a
      careful bit of medical detective work, the physician and the principal of
      the high school determined that the infection came from the use of a
      bath-towel in the house of a fellow-pupil where the patient had spent two
      or three nights. This pupil was examined and found to have a fully
      developed case, which he had concealed, in fear of disgrace. Consequently,
      the poison is now so deep-seated in him that it may be years before he is
      cured. He made a confession implicating a girl in the class above him. A
      rigid investigation followed which brought the other cases to light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take Julia out of that school at once,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Clyde, half-crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; controverted the Health Master gently. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
      do that. In the complex life of a city like this, it is impossible to
      shelter a girl completely and permanently. Better armor her with
      knowledge. Besides, the danger in the school, being discovered, is
      practically over now. In time, and using this experience as a lever with
      the school authorities, we hope to get a course of lectures on hygiene
      established, including simple sex-instruction. Meantime this must be
      carried on by the mothers and fathers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to say to Julia?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I am going to tell you,&rdquo; replied the Health
      Master, &ldquo;and look to you to pass on the truth in terms too plain to
      admit of any misunderstanding. First, does she know what womanhood and
      motherhood mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, I think. She seems so young. And it&rsquo;s so hard to
      speak of those things. But I thought I would try to explain to her some
      day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day? At once! How can you think her too young? She has already
      undergone the vital change from childhood to womanhood, and without so
      much as a word of warning or reassurance or explanation as to what it
      means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite without,&rdquo; put in Grandma Sharpless quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; approved the Health Master. &ldquo;But be sure that
      the explanation is thorough. Tell her the significance of sex and its
      relation to reproduction and life. If you don&rsquo;t, be sure that others
      will. And their version may well be in terms which would make a mother
      shudder to hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would tell her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her playmates. Do you think that girls don&rsquo;t talk of the
      mysteries as much as boys? If so, you&rsquo;re sadly in error. The first
      essential is that she should understand truly and wisely what it means to
      be a woman. That is fundamental. And now for the matter of venereal
      disease. I am going to lay certain facts before you all, and you can hand
      on to the children such modifications as you deem best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, gonorrhoea, because it is the worse of the two. That is not
      the accepted notion, I know: but the leading specialists one by one have
      come around to the view, that, by and large, it does more damage to
      humanity than the more greatly dreaded syphilis. For one thing, it is much
      more widespread. While there are no accurate statistics covering the field
      in general, it is fairly certain that forty per cent of all men over
      thirty-five in our larger cities have had the disease at some time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem possible,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to you, because you married early, and your associations have
      been largely with family, home-loving men. But ask any one of the
      traveling salesmen in your factory his view. Your traveling man is the
      Ulysses of modern life, &lsquo;knowing cities and the hearts of men.&rsquo;
      I think that you&rsquo;ll find that compared with the &lsquo;commercial&rsquo;
      view, my forty per cent is optimistic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is easily curable, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Clyde,
      insensibly yielding to the Health Master&rsquo;s matter-of-fact tone, and
      finding, almost insensibly, that her interest in the hygienic problem had
      overcome her shamed reluctance to speak of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often in the early stages. But it is very uncertain. And once
      firmly fixed on the victim, it is one of the most obstinate and
      treacherous of diseases. It may lie dormant for months or even years,
      deceiving its victim into thinking himself wholly cured, only to break out
      again in full conflagration, without warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the history of many ruined marriages. Only by the most
      searching tests can a physician make certain that the infection is stamped
      out. Probably no disease receives, on the average, such harmful treatment
      by those who are appealed to to cure it. The reason for this is that the
      young man with his first &lsquo;dose&rsquo;&mdash;that loathsome, light
      term of description!&mdash;is ashamed to go to his family physician, and
      so takes worthless patent medicines or falls into the hands of some
      &lsquo;Men&rsquo;s Specialist&rsquo; who advertises a &lsquo;sure cure&rsquo;
      in the papers. These charlatans make their money, not by skillful and
      scientific treatment, of which they know nothing, nor by seeking to effect
      a cure, but by actually nourishing the flame of the disease, so as to keep
      the patient under their care as long as possible, all the time building up
      fat fees for themselves. If they were able, as they claim, to stop the
      infection in a few days at a small fee, they couldn&rsquo;t make money
      enough to pay for the scoundrelly lies which constitute their
      advertisements. While they are collecting their long-extended payments
      from the victim, the infection is spreading and extending its roots more
      and more deeply, until the unfortunate may be ruined for life, or even
      actually killed by the ravages of the malignant germs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose that it was ever fatal,&rdquo; said Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I&rsquo;ve seen deaths in hospitals, of the most agonizing&rsquo;
      kind. But it is by virtue of its byproducts, so to speak, that gonorrhoea
      is most injurious and is really more baneful to the race than syphilis.
      The organism which causes it is in a high degree destructive to the eyes.
      Newborn infants are very frequently infected in this way by gonorrhoeal
      mothers. Probably a quarter of all permanent blindness in this country is
      caused by gonorrhoea. The effect of the disease upon women is disastrous.
      Half of all abdominal operations on married women, excluding appendicitis,
      are the results of gonorrhoeal infection from their husbands. A large
      proportion of sterility arises from this cause. A large proportion of the
      wives of men in whom the infection has not been wholly eradicated pay the
      penalty in permanently undermined health. And yet the superstition endures
      that &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no worse than a bad cold.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no such superstition about syphilis, at least,&rdquo;
      remarked Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The very name is a portent of terror, and it is well that it
      should be so. The consequence is that the man who finds himself afflicted
      takes no chances, as a rule. He goes straight to the best physician he can
      find, and obeys orders under terror of his life. Thus and thus only, he
      often is cured. Terrible as syphilis is, there is this redeeming feature:
      we can tell pretty accurately when the organism which causes it is
      eliminated. Years after the disease itself is cured, however, the victim
      may be stricken down by the most terrible form of paralysis, resulting
      from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the Ehrlich treatment regarded as a sure cure?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No cure is sure. Salvarsan, skillfully administered, is as near a
      specific as any known form of treatment. But we don&rsquo;t know whether
      it has any effect at all upon locomotor ataxia or general paralysis, the
      after effects, which may destroy the patient fifteen or twenty years after
      the actual disease has been cured. All locomotor ataxia and all general
      paralysis come from syphilis. And these diseases are not only incurable,
      but are as nearly a hell on earth as poor humanity is ever called upon to
      endure. Of course, you know that a man who is base enough to marry with
      syphilis dooms his children. Fortunately seventy-five or eighty per cent
      of the offspring of such marriages die in infancy or early childhood. The
      rest grow up deficient in mind or body or both. Upwards of ten per cent of
      all insanity is syphilitic in its origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both venereal diseases are terribly contagious. Innocence is no
      protection. Syphilis may be contracted from a drinking-cup or
      eating-utensil, or from the lips of an infected person having an open sore
      on the mouth. Gonorrhoea is spread by towels, by bathtubs, or from
      contaminated toilets. No person, however careful, is immune from either of
      the &lsquo;red plagues.&rsquo; And yet the public is just beginning to be
      educated to the peril.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t that be a good topic for the Woman&rsquo;s Club
      to discuss?&rdquo; asked Grandma Sharpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; said Dr. Strong. &ldquo;That is, if they would
      allow you to talk about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Allow</i> me!&rdquo; The old lady&rsquo;s firm chin tilted up
      sharply. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to put the ban of silence on me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody, I dare say, if you make up your mind to speak,&rdquo;
      replied Dr. Strong, smiling. &ldquo;But some will probably try. Would you
      believe that, only a short time since, a professor of hygiene in one of
      our leading universities had to abandon a course of lectures to the
      students because the wives of the faculty and trustees objected to his
      including venereal diseases in his course? And a well-known lecturer, who
      had been invited to speak on health protection before a list of colleges,
      suffered the indignity of having the invitation withdrawn because he
      insisted that he could not cover the ground without warning his hearers
      against the twin pestilences of vice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the colleges so greatly in need of that sort of warning?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Subsequent records obtained from some of the protesting
      institutions showed that one third of the students had at some time been
      infected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve told my boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clyde,
      rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to my girls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I to the women,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sharpless. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d
      better make a list, for both of you, of the literature on the subject
      which you will find useful,&rdquo; said the Health Master. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      give it to you later.&rdquo; *

      For a time after the women had left, the two men sat silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde presently, &ldquo;who is Bartley
      Starr&rsquo;s physician?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Emery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he warn him not to marry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did. He positively forbade it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Starr married that young girl in the face of that prohibition?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought he was cured. Dr. Emery couldn&rsquo;t say positively
      that he wasn&rsquo;t. He could only beg him to wait another year. Starr
      hadn&rsquo;t the courage&mdash;or the principle; he feared scandal if he
      postponed the wedding. So he disregarded the warning and now the scandal
      is upon him with tenfold weight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any law for such cases?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in this state. Indiana requires that parties to a marriage
      swear to their freedom from venereal disease and certain other ailments.
      Other states have followed suit. Every state ought to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t Dr. Emery go to the girl&rsquo;s father, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of our damnable law,&rdquo; returned the Health Master with
      a sudden and rare access of bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that the law forbids?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It holds the physician liable for any professional confidence
      violated.&rdquo; Dr. Strong rose and paced up and down the room, talking
      with repressed energy. &ldquo;Therein it follows medical ethics in its
      most conservative and baneful phase. The code of medical conduct provides
      that a physician is bound to keep secret all the private affairs of a
      patient, learned in the course of practice. One body, the American
      Institute of Homoeopathy, has wisely amended its code to except those
      cases where &lsquo;harm to others may result.&rsquo; That amendment was
      passed with particular reference to venereal disease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about contagious disease?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
      the law require the physician to report diphtheria, for instance, and thus
      violate the patient&rsquo;s confidence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it does. All schools recognize that principle of
      protection to the public. Yet, in the case of syphilis or gonorrhoea, when
      the harm to the public health is far greater than from any &lsquo;reportable&rsquo;
      disease except tuberculosis, the physician must hold his peace, though he
      sees his patient pass out of his hands bearing fire and sword and poison
      to future generations. There&rsquo;s the Ban of Silence in its most
      diabolical form!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clyde regarded his household physician keenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
      before seen you so stirred,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reason to be stirred.&rdquo; The Health Master whirled
      suddenly upon his friend and employer. &ldquo;Clyde, you&rsquo;ve never
      questioned me as to my past.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never wanted it cleared up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been willing to take me on trust?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I appreciate it. But now I&rsquo;m going to tell you how I
      happened to come to you, a broken and ruined man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think it over, Strong,&rdquo; advised Mr. Clyde. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      speak now. Not that it would make any difference to me. I know you. If you
      were to tell me that you had committed homicide, I&rsquo;d believe that it
      was a necessary and justifiable homicide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suicide, rather,&rdquo; returned the other with a mirthless laugh;
      &ldquo;professional suicide. I&rsquo;ll speak now, if you don&rsquo;t
      object.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, then, if it will ease your mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lawbreaker, Clyde. I did, years ago, what you thought
      Emery should have done. I deliberately violated the profession&rsquo;s Ban
      of Silence. The man was my patient, in the city where I had built up a
      good high-class practice. He had contracted gonorrhoea and I had treated
      him for a year. The infection seemed to be rooted out. But I knew the
      danger, and when he told me that he was engaged to be married, to a girl
      of my own set and a valued friend, I was horror-stricken. I pleaded,
      argued, and finally threatened. It was no use. He was the spoiled child of
      a wealthy family, impatient of any thwarting. One day the suspicions of
      the girl&rsquo;s mother were aroused. She came to me in deep distress. I
      told her the truth. The engagement was broken. The man did not bring suit
      against me, but his family used their financial and social power to
      persecute and finally drive me out of the city, a nervous wreck. That&rsquo;s
      my history.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could have protected yourself by telling the true facts,&rdquo;
      suggested Clyde. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: but that would have been an unforgivable breach of confidence.
      The public had no right to the facts. The girl&rsquo;s family had.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they should have come to your rescue with the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bound them to secrecy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Mr. Clyde rose, walked over, picked up the paper with the staring
      headlines, folded it, laid it on the table, and, in passing the physician,
      set a hand, as if by chance, upon his shoulder. From so undemonstrative a
      man the action meant much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said with affectionate lightness, &ldquo;my Chinese
      physician had been fighting dragons before he ever came to us; worse
      monsters than he&rsquo;s been called upon to face, since. That was a
      splendid defeat, Strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bitter one,&rdquo; said the Health Master; &ldquo;and by the same
      old Monster, in another manifestation that we&rsquo;ve been fighting here.
      We&rsquo;ve downed him now and again, you and I, Clyde. But he&rsquo;s
      never killed: only scotched. He&rsquo;s the universal ally of every ill
      that man hands on to man, and we&rsquo;ve only to recognize him under the
      thousand and one different forms he assumes to call him out to battle
      under his real name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo; inquired Clyde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignorance,&rdquo; said the Health Master.
    </p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
